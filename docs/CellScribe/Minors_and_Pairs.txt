Minors
------

There are two options for specifying minors for a reaction:

    1.  Write all minor metabolites as a list under the minors option.
    2.  Do not specify any minors, using the default minors provided by
        "MinorSuggestion" objects in metabolites.py.

If you specify any minors for a reaction using the "minors" keyword, then all
MinorSuggestion calls will be ignored.  For the special case where you don't
want any minors for a reaction, use

    my_rxn = Reaction(..., minors=[])

Because the "minors" keyword appears, all MinorSuggestions will be ignored.


Metabolite Pairs
----------------

Metabolite pairs are suggested by PairSet objects.  The line

    PairSet(atp, adp, amp)

indicates that anytime at least two of atp, adp, or amp appear in a reaction,
they should be paired.  You can specify additional pairings using the "pairs"
keyword in the Reaction definition.  By contrast with MinorSuggestions,
defining "pairs" does not cause the PairSets to be ignored.  For example:

    my_rxn = Reaction(reactants=glucose + atp,
                      products=glucose_6_phosphate + adp,
                      pairs=[glucose, glucose_6_phosphate])

With the PairSet defined previously, this reaction will have two sets of pairs,
(glucose, glucose_6_phosphate) and (atp, adp).  However, anytime you explicitly
define a pair that includes a metabolite in a PairSet, the PairSet will be
ignored.  You can force a PairSet to be ignored by including a "pair" with
only one metabolite.  For example:

    PairSet(a, b)
    Reaction(reactants=a,
             products=b + c,
             pairs=[(a)])

In this example, "a" will not be paired with "b".

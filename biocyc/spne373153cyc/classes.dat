UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Features
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of of this class define a region of interest on a polypeptide, plus, 
/optionally, one or more states associated with the region.  Different subclasses are used to specify
/points, linear regions, and regions involving noncontiguous segments of an amino-acid chain.
/
/If there is a need to refer to two different states of a protein with a given feature (e.g. phosphorylated or
/unphosphorylated, metal-bound or not, crosslinked or not)  a Modified-Protein frame must be created
/that points back to the unmodified form.  Both forms of the protein point to the same feature, but the state
/annotation on the feature for each form indicates whether it is modified or not, or bound or not.  The state of a feature 
/can be left unspecified if it is not relevant to interactions of a particular protein form, and of course many 
/feature classes have no state.  The slot Possible-Feature-States indicates whether or not a feature class
/can have multiple states, and what those states are.
/
/For example, an instance F of this class could define an amino-acid residue that
/can be phosphorylated, plus the fact that this residue can take on two possible
/states: MODIFIED (i.e. phosphorylated) and UNMODIFIED (i.e. unphosphorylated).   The feature instance
/itself does not describe the state of a particular protein.  Instead, we would
/represent the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of a protein by
/creating two instances of class Proteins.  Both of those instances, in their
/FEATURES slot, would contain the value F, linking to the same feature
/instance.  However, in the two proteins, F would be annotated differently
/to indicate the state of that feature.   One protein would use an 
/annotation label STATE with a value MODIFIED to denote
/that the residue is phosphorylated, and would also be classified under the class Modified-Proteins,
/whereas the other would have the value UNMODIFIED for the state annotation.
/
/Most covalent modifications to proteins can be found in the subclass Modification-Features.  For these
/features, the specific class of the feature usually unambiguously defines the modification (if it does not,
/the chemical structure slots can be used for that purpose).  
/
/For cases in which a protein forms a non-covalent complex with some other entity, this is represented
/using an instance of the Complexes class.  In this case, a feature may be created to specify where on the protein
/the other entity binds (with the ATTACHED-GROUP slot indicating its identity), but it is rarely 
/necessary to indicate the state of the feature -- interactions refer to either the
/protein or the complex, but rarely need to distinguish between the complex, the protein within the complex, and the
/free protein.  If however it is necessary to distinguish between those three cases, then, as in the covalent modification
/case, a modified protein would need to be created, and the state (BOUND or UNBOUND) of the feature would need
/to be set for each form of the protein.

UNIQUE-ID - Growth-Observations
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class record observations of growth/no-growth for the wildtype organism and/or various gene knockouts.
/One instance of this frame can record whether a single organism (wildtype or knockout mutant) grows on a single growth medium,
/or, for purposes of compactness, it can record that a set of one or more knockouts (or wildtype) grows or does not grow on a 
/set of one or more growth media.  However, all knockouts or media grouped together in a single instance should be part of 
/a single experiment or coherent set of experiments (i.e. the same citations and comment applies to all), must describe growth at 
/a single temperature, and must all exhibit the same growth status (none, low or normal growth).

UNIQUE-ID - Generalized-Reactions
TYPES - FRAMES
//
UNIQUE-ID - Polymer-Segments
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Describes a linear region of a polymer, such a a segment of a DNA 
/molecule or of an amino-acid chain.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Evidence
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - The Evidence class defines a controlled vocabulary of evidence types.  Each term in the vocabulary 
/defines a type of evidence that pertains to an assertion in this database.  Example assertions include 
/the assertion that a pathway exists, or the assertion that an operon exists.  Example uses of the 
/evidence vocabulary are to record what type of evidence supports the assertion that an operon exists, 
/such as whether the evidence is based on a computational analysis or a wet-lab experiment, and if the 
/latter, what type of wet-lab experiment.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Enzymatic-Reactions
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines an association between an enzyme and
/a reaction that the enzyme catalyzes.  The slots of this class define
/information specific to that association, such as small molecules that
/act as cofactors of the catalysis of that
/reaction by that enzyme, and kinetic parameters of the enzyme.
/Enzymatic-Reactions also link via the Regulated-By slot to
/objects that define substrate-level regulation of this enzyme activity.
/It is improper to store that information with either the reaction or the
/enzyme because a given enzyme might catalyze multiple reactions,
/and a given reaction might be catalyzed by more than one enzyme.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This class describes most forms of protein, RNA or activity regulation.  Regulation can be either by a direct influence on the protein's activity 
/(e.g. allosteric inhibition of an enzyme) or by influencing the quantity of active protein available (e.g. by inducing or blocking its transcription 
/or translation).  The one form of regulation that is not covered by this class is when the quantity of a protein is regulated as a result of chemical 
/or binding reactions that either produce or consume the active form of a protein -- these are represented as Reactions instead.  There can be
/some ambiguity as to what should be represented as a reaction and what should be represented as a regulation event.  In general, an event that
/can be represented as a reaction should be when a) there is sufficiently detailed information known to model it as a reaction, b) both reactants
/and products exist as stable, independent entities, and c) our schema supports referring to both reactant and product of the reaction independently 
/and there is some justification for wanting to go down to that level of detail.  For example, a transcription factor bound to a small molecule will 
/generally have a different activity than the unbound transcription factor.  This could be represented either as the reaction TF + x -> TF-x or as 
/a regulation event in which x activates or inhibits the activity of TF.  However, because both TF and TF-x are stable molecules which can 
/potentially regulate different transcription units (not all will, but some do), or TF could bind another small molecule y and regulate yet another set 
/of transcription units, we prefer to model this kind of interaction as a reaction when the data is available.  On the other hand, an enzyme binding to 
/some inhibitor could also be represented as a reaction, but since there is rarely any reason to refer to the enzyme-inhibitor complex outside of
/the context of the reaction the enzyme catalyzes, we choose instead to model these events as regulation events in which the inhibitor regulates the
/activity of the enzyme.
/
/Instances of this class represent a one-to-one mapping between regulator and regulated-entity (i.e. an entity may regulate many processes,  or a
/process may be regulated by many entities, but each one requires its own instance of Regulation to represent it)

UNIQUE-ID - KB-DESCRIPTOR
TYPES - FRAMES
//
UNIQUE-ID - Publications
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class are publications, usually those cited within a PGDB.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Organisms
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - The Organisms class is used in different ways in organism-specific
/PGDBs versus in multiorganism PGDBs such as MetaCyc.  The
/next paragraph discusses what is common to both types of PGDBs.
/Subsequent paragraphs describe the differences.
/
/In all PGDBs, subclasses of Organisms define biological taxa, at all
/possible taxonomic levels.  Class-subclass relationships between
/subclasses of Organisms describe their taxonomic relationships,
/since, for example, the class Bacteria includes as a subclass the
/class Alphaproteobacteria.  Generally, most of the taxonomic
/groups under Organisms correspond to entries from the NCBI Taxonomy 
/database (which is stored in its entirety in a separate Ocelot KB).  But in
/addition to taxa from NCBI Taxonomy, a PGDB can contain subclasses 
/for additional taxa that are not present in the NCBI Taxonomy. 
/
/Organism-specific PGDBs:  In an organism-specific PGDB, the only
/frames that exist as children of Organisms are those frames needed to
/describe the taxonomic lineage of the organism described by the PGDB.
/An organism-specific PGDB contains a single instance frame that
/describes information about the PGDB itself.  A parent class P of that 
/instance must exist to describe the lowest taxonomic group defined for the
/organism.  Additional parent classes exist as parents of P and
/children of Organisms that describe the other known taxonomic
/parents of P.  No other children of Organisms exist in the PGDB.
/
/Multiorganism PGDBs such as MetaCyc:  Multiorganism PGDBs contain
/no instances of class Organisms, but only subclasses of this class.  Those 
/subclasses define each of the different organisms for which MetaCyc
/(for example) defines pathways and enzymes.  For economy of storage, 
/only those taxa (and their parent taxa) actually referenced in the PGDB are
/stored in the PGDB, so that only a subset of the NCBI Taxonomy is 
/replicated in the PGDB. There is only one instance of  
/Multi-Organism-Groupings that describes the properties of the PGDB.

UNIQUE-ID - Gene-Ontology-Terms
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Class Gene-Ontology-Terms is the root of the Gene Ontology (GO).  In a PGDB,
/gene products (including monomers, multimers, and chemically modified forms
/thereof) are assigned to GO terms in this hierarchy.  Note that a PGDB does not contain
/the entire GO ontology, only those terms (and their parents) to which gene products have been assigned.
/To browse the entire GO ontology, visit the <a href="http://www.geneontology.org">GO website</a>.

UNIQUE-ID - Chemicals
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - a chemical

TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMENT - Describes a feature that is a contiguous linear region of an amino-acid chain.  
/The location of the region is specified using slots LEFT-END-POSITION
/and RIGHT-END-POSITION.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Binding-Features
TYPES - Protein-Features
COMMENT - Describes a feature that binds some other entity, such as a small molecule, site of some other protein, etc.
/Slot ATTACHED-GROUP specifies that entity.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Amino-Acid-Sites
TYPES - Protein-Features
COMMENT - Members of this class describe modifications to, binding to,or
/other interesting features of one or more specific (and generally 
/non-contiguous) amino acid residues in a polypeptide, as 
/opposed to a larger bounded region.  The set of residues
/defining the feature is encoded using slots RESIDUE-NUMBER
/(which lists the index within the amino-acid sequence of the
/indicated residue), and RESIDUE-TYPE (which lists the
/one-letter code of that residue).  The values of these two
/slots must be in parallel order.  The second slot is needed in
/cases where the full amino-acid sequence of the protein is not available.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Primary-Growth-Observations
TYPES - Growth-Observations
COMMENT - Instances of this class record primary observations of growth/no-growth for the wildtype organism and/or various gene knockouts,
/as described in the primary literature.
/One instance of this frame can record whether a single organism (wildtype or knockout mutant) grows on a single growth medium,
/or, for purposes of compactness, it can record that a set of one or more knockouts (or wildtype) grows or does not grow on a 
/set of one or more growth media.  However, all knockouts or media grouped together in a single instance should be part of 
/a single experiment or coherent set of experiments (i.e. the same citations and comment applies to all), must describe growth at 
/a single temperature, and must all exhibit the same growth status (none, low or normal growth).
//
UNIQUE-ID - Consensus-Growth-Results
TYPES - Growth-Observations
COMMENT - Instances of this class do not represent primary growth observations.  Rather, if there are multiple conflicting growth observations for a particular medium/knockout, then an instance of this class can be used to represent the consensus view of what the correct growth-status result should be for those conditions.  Generally at most one instance of this class will exist for a given medium/knockout/temperature combination.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Reactions
TYPES - Generalized-Reactions
COMMENT - An instance of this class is a chemical transformation of some type.  It
/may involve small molecules or macromolecules.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Pathways
TYPES - Generalized-Reactions
COMMENT - This class is the root of a classification hierarchy for metabolic
/pathways.  Its subclasses divide pathways into groups
/based on their biological functions, and based on the classes
/of metabolites that they produce and/or consume.
//
UNIQUE-ID - mRNA-Segments
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMENT - This class defines segments within mRNA transcripts.  Although any given mRNA is a transcript of only
/a small portion of the replicon, for precision's sake, start and end locations of mRNA segments are defined relative to the start
/of the corresponding replicon, not relative to the start of the mRNA transcript.  This approach also
/allows us to avoid creation of frames for the transcripts themselves.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Polymer-Segment-Enzyme-Substrates
TYPES - Compounds
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMENT - This class contains reaction substrates that stand for a segment or section of an extended polymer, like a nucleic acid.
/An enzyme might typically recognize a limited motif on the polymer, but the detailed sequence of the full length polymer will not matter in such reactions.
//
UNIQUE-ID - DNA-Segments
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMON-NAME - a DNA segment
COMMENT - Describes a region of a DNA molecule, such as a gene or a promoter.
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-AS
TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - Author statement
COMMENT - Author statement.  The evidence for an assertion comes from an author
/statement in a publication, where that publication does not state direct experimental support
/for the assertion.  Ordinarily, this code will not be used directly -- generally one of
/its child codes, EV-TAS or EV-NAS, will be used instead.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-IC

COMMON-NAME - Inferred by curator
COMMENT - Inferred by curator.  An assertion was inferred by a curator from relevant

COMMON-NAME - Inferred from experiment
COMMENT - Inferred from experiment.  The evidence for an assertion comes from a
/wet-lab experiment of some type.

//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-COMP
TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - Inferred by computational analysis
COMMENT - Inferred from computation.  The evidence for an assertion comes from a
/computational analysis.  The assertion itself might have been made
/by a person or by a computer, that is, EV-COMP does not specify whether
/manual interpretation of the computation occurred.
/
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-ND
TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - No biological Data available
COMMENT - EV-ND is intended for use in GO annotations.
/
/Use of the EV-ND evidence code indicates that the annotator at the contributing database found no information
/that allowed making an annotation to any term indicating specific knowledge from the ontology in question
/(molecular function, biological process, or cellular component) as of the date indicated. This code should be used only
/for annotations to the root terms, molecular function ; GO:0003674, biological process ; GO:0008150, or cellular component ; GO:0005575,
/which, when used in annotations, indicate that no knowledge is available about a gene product in that aspect of GO.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Enzyme-Activity
TYPES - Regulation
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe substrate-level modulation of enzyme activity.  The
/situation where a small molecule competitively inhibits an enzyme activity would
/be represented as follows:
/Regulator            = The small molecule
/Regulated-Entity = The enzymatic reaction for that enzyme activity
/Mechanism          = Competitive
/Mode                  = +
/
/Possible mechanisms and their definitions are as follows:
/Allosteric          -- Allosteric regulators increase or decrease the enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that alters the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX.
/Competitive       -- Competitive inhibitors bind reversibly to the enzyme, preventing the substrate from binding.  Binding of the inhibitor and substrate are mutually exclusive because it is assumed that the inhibitor and substrate can both bind only to the free enzyme.
/Noncompetitive  -- Noncompetitive inhibitors can bind to either the free enzyme or to the enzyme-substrate complex.  The inhibitor and substrate may be bound to the enzyme simultaneously and do not exclude each other.  However, only the enzyme-substrate complex (not the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex) is catalytically active.
/Uncompetitive    -- Uncompetitive inhibitors inhibit the enzyme by binding reversibly to the enzyme-substrate complex, but not to the enzyme alone.
/Mixed               -- Mixed inhibitors can bind to either the free enzyme or the enzyme-substrate complex, and decrease the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate.
/Irreversible        -- Irreversible inhibitors bind to the enzyme and dissociate so slowly that it is considered irreversible.  For example, alkylating agents such as iodoacetamide irreversibly inhibit the catalytic activity of some enzymes by modifying cysteine side chains.
/Other                -- Regulators that regulate the enzyme activity by a mechanism that has been characterized but cannot be clearly classified as one of the above mechanisms.
/
/If no mechanism is specified, then the mechanism is unknown, either because the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or because a full literature search has yet to be performed.

COMMENT - The N-terminal portion of a secretory or membrane protein that assists it
/across the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it is
/synthesized, but is cleaved from the protein even before the synthesis of the
/protein is complete. Mitochondrial and chloroplast proteins that are synthesized

UNIQUE-ID - Transmembrane-Regions
TYPES - Protein-Segments
COMMENT - A feature of most intrinsic proteins of plasma or vesicular membranes; a

TYPES - Protein-Segments
COMMENT - A motif of which seven or more may appear in a DNA-binding protein. Each is
/characterized by two closely spaced cysteine and two histidine residues that
/serve as ligands for a single Zn2+. When bound to Zn2+ they form a module
/from which protrude amino acid side chains that interact with the bases
/partially exposed to the DNA major groove. Since in the area of contact there is
/a limited and local parallel of DNA and protein sequences, the occurrence of the
/contacting amino acid residues in the protein sequence falls into a regularity, or

COMMENT - This class is the root of an ontology in which reactions are classified according to
/the class of their substrates.  This classification scheme is orthogonal to the
/classification by conversion type, that is, reactions will have parents in both
/ontologies.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Unclassified-Reactions
TYPES - Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Unclassified reactions
COMMENT - Reactions that have not yet been classified either by substrate or by conversion type.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Energy-Metabolism
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Generation of Precursor Metabolites and Energy
COMMENT - This class contains the pathways of central metabolism (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathways, and TCA cycle), which collectively produce the 13 starting materials, sometimes termed precursor metabolites, for all cellular biosyntheses. Other degradative pathways, sometimes termed feeder pathways, feed into central metabolism. This class also contains the pathways that generate energy under various conditions of growth.  
//
UNIQUE-ID - Detoxification
TYPES - Pathways
COMMENT - This class contains pathways by which various organisms protect themselves 
/against the harmful effects of toxic compounds.
/The sole purpose of these pathways is to avoid toxicity, with no other 
/benefit (such as energy or useful metabolites) to the organism.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Metabolic-Clusters
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Metabolic Clusters
COMMENT - A metabolic cluster is a set of biochemical reactions that are biologically related, but are largely unconnected, 
/and therefore do not constitute a pathway in the traditional sense of the word.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Signaling-Pathways
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Signal transduction pathways
COMMENT - Signalling pathways.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Super-Pathways
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Superpathways
COMMENT - Pathways within this class are constructed by combining individual pathways
/(elsewhere shown separately) to show relationships between them.
/In some cases those individual pathways start from a common precursor, or
/produce a common product, but they can have other relationships as well.
/Superpathways can have individual reactions as their components in addition to
/other pathways.  Superpathways can be defined recursively, that is, the
/component pathway of a Superpathway can be a base pathway or a child of
/Superpathways.  Most Superpathways will have an additional parent class
/within the pathway ontology to define their biological role.

UNIQUE-ID - Transport-Pathways
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Transport
//
UNIQUE-ID - Activation-Inactivation-Interconversion
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Activation/Inactivation/Interconversion
COMMENT - This class holds pathways for activation, inactivation, and interconversion of
/metabolic compounds.
/
/In contrast to a standard "biosynthesis" pathway in which a biologically active
/compound is synthesized from precursor molecules, activation pathways involve
/relatively minor chemical modifications to existing compounds that result in a
/substantial increase in their biological activity.
/
/Similarly, in contrast to standard "degradation" pathways in which a more complex
/compound is broken down into a set of simple metabolites, inactivation pathways
/involve relatively minor chemical modifications to existing biologically active
/compounds that result in a substantial decrease in their biological activity.
/
/
/Interconversion pathways describe the bidirectional conversion of a bio-molecule
/to a different form. The forward and backward conversions often result in
/significant changes in the biological activity of the compound, thus resulting in its
/activation and deactivation, respectively.
/
/These modifications may be either reversible or irreversible.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Biosynthesis
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Biosynthesis
COMMENT - This class contains pathways that constitute a cell's complete spectrum of biosynthetic capacities, including the routes of synthesis of small molecules, macromolecules and cell structure components.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Degradation
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Degradation/Utilization/Assimilation

COMMENT - Instances of this class describe promoter regions.
//
UNIQUE-ID - SNPs
TYPES - DNA-Segments
COMMENT - Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms
//
UNIQUE-ID - Transcription-Units
TYPES - DNA-Segments
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines a transcription unit, meaning a set of one
/or more genes that are transcribed to produce a single messenger RNA.  
/The differences between a transcription unit and an operon
/are (1) Technically, an operon must include more than one gene.  
/(2) An operon may include more than one promoter.  For operons that
/include multiple promoters, a transcription unit is defined for each promoter.
/
/A transcription unit should have as its components one or more genes,
/zero or one promoter, and zero or more terminators.  Transcription factor binding sites
/need not be components of a transcription unit.  A one-to-one correspondence is
/defined between a transcription unit and a promoter plus set of genes.  Promoters can
/be omitted if the transcription start site is unknown, in which case the correspondence
/is between a transcription unit and a set of genes.  Multiple terminators can be included 
/in a transcription-unit, but typically a separate transcription unit is defined for each 
/different set of transcribed genes (an exception is made for attenuators --
/generally no transcription unit is defined for the truncated transcript produced by
/attenuation, even if it includes the gene for a leader peptide).
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Transposons
TYPES - DNA-Segments
//
UNIQUE-ID - DNA-Binding-Sites

UNIQUE-ID - All-Genes
TYPES - DNA-Segments
COMMENT - The class All-Genes includes as its subclasses the set of true genes (class Genes), as
/well as sets of gene-like sequences.  The latter includes class Phantom-Genes
/(sequences that were predicted to be genes by computational gene-finding
/programs, but that were later determined not to be genes, such as through
/experimentation),  and class Pseudo-Genes.    Therefore, to enumerate all true
/genes in an organism, query the instances of class Genes, not class All-Genes.

//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-AS-HYPO
TYPES - EV-AS
COMMON-NAME - Author hypothesis
COMMENT - Author hypothesis. The hypothesis is in a publication, but it was clearly indicated in the
/publication that there was no experimental evidence, or limited evidence, supporting the 
/hypothesis. This code can be used, for example, for "paper chemistry" metabolic pathways, 
/which are pathways drawn from the author's best estimation.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-AS-TAS
TYPES - EV-AS
COMMON-NAME - Traceable author statement
COMMENT - Traceable author statement.  The assertion was made in a publication -- such as a review or 
/in another database -- that itself did not describe an experiment supporting the
/assertion.  The statement referenced another publication that supported the assertion,
/but it is unclear whether that publication described an experiment that supported
/the assertion.  The difference between the codes EV-EXP-TAS and EV-AS-TAS 
/is that the former code is used when it is certain that experimental evidence supports the
/assertion, and the latter code is used when there is a possibility that an experiment was
/not done to support the assertion.
/In general, references to the primary literature are preferred,
/but this code can be used when the original article is difficult to locate.
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-AS-NAS
TYPES - EV-AS
COMMON-NAME - Non-traceable author statement
COMMENT - Non-traceable author statement.  The assertion was made in a publication such as a review, a meeting abstract, 
/or another database without a reference to a publication describing an experiment that supports the assertion.
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-IC-ADJ-GENES-SAME-BIO-PROCESS
TYPES - EV-IC
COMMON-NAME - Products of adjacent genes in the same biological process
COMMENT - A transcription unit is inferred because there is a set of adjacent genes,
/encoded in the same direction, coding for products that participate in the
/same metabolic pathway or biological process. Sometimes, these genes code
/for subunits of the same protein.
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-EXP-IMP
TYPES - EV-EXP
COMMON-NAME - Inferred from mutant phenotype
COMMENT - IMP inferred from mutant phenotype.<br>
/The assertion was inferred from a mutant phenotype such as
/<ul>
/    <li> Any gene mutation/knockout
/    <li> Overexpression/ectopic expression of wild-type or mutant genes
/    <li> Anti-sense experiments
/    <li> RNA interference experiments
/    <li> Specific protein inhibitors
/    <li> Complementation
/</ul><p>	
/Comment: Inferences made from examining mutations or
/abnormal levels of only the product(s) of the gene of interest are covered by code EV-IMP
/(compare to code EV-IGI). Use this code for experiments that use antibodies 
/or other specific inhibitors of RNA or protein activity, even though no
/gene may be mutated (the rationale is that EV-IMP is used where an
/abnormal situation prevails in a cell or organism).
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-EXP-IGI
TYPES - EV-EXP
COMMON-NAME - Inferred from genetic interaction
COMMENT - IGI inferred from genetic interaction.<br>
/The assertion was inferred from a genetic interaction such as
/<ul>
/    <li> "Traditional" genetic interactions such as suppressors, synthetic lethals, etc.
/    <li> Functional complementation
/    <li> Inference about one gene drawn from the phenotype of a mutation in a different gene
/</ul><p>
/This category includes any combination of alterations in the sequence
/(mutation) or expression of more than one gene/gene product. This
/category can therefore cover any of the IMP experiments that are done
/in a non-wild-type background, although we prefer to use it only when
/all mutations are documented. When redundant copies of a gene must all
/be mutated to see an informative phenotype, use the IGI code. (Yes, 
/this implies some organisms, such as mouse, will have far, far more IGI
/than IMP annotations.)<p>
/
/IMP also covers phenotypic similarity: a phenotype that is informative
/because it is similar to that of another independent phenotype (which
/may have been described earlier or documented more fully) is IMP (not IGI).<p>
/
/We have also decided to use this category for situations where a
/mutation in one gene (gene A) provides information about the function,
/process, or component of another gene (gene B; i.e. annotate gene B
/using IGI).
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-EXP-TAS
TYPES - EV-EXP
COMMON-NAME - Traceable author statement to experimental support
COMMENT - Traceable author statement to experimental support.  The assertion was made in a publication -- such as a review or 
/in another database -- that itself did not describe an experiment supporting the
/assertion.  However, the statement did reference another publication describing an experiment 
/that supports the assertion.  The difference between the codes EV-EXP-TAS and EV-AS-TAS 
/is that the former code is used when it is certain that experimental evidence supports the
/assertion, and the latter code is used when there is a possibility that an experiment was
/not done to support the assertion.

//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-EXP-IEP
TYPES - EV-EXP
COMMON-NAME - Inferred from expression pattern
COMMENT - IEP inferred from expression pattern.<br>
/The assertion was inferred from a pattern of expression data such as
/<ul>
/    <li> Transcript levels (e.g. Northerns, microarray data)
/    <li> Protein levels (e.g. Western blots)
/</ul>
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-EXP-IPI
TYPES - EV-EXP
COMMON-NAME - Inferred from physical interaction
COMMENT - IPI inferred from physical interaction<br>
/The assertion was inferred from a physical interaction such as
/<ul>
/    <li> 2-hybrid interactions
/    <li> Co-purification
/    <li> Co-immunoprecipitation
/    <li> Ion/protein binding experiments
/</ul><p>
/This code covers physical interactions between the gene product of
/interest and another molecule (or ion, or complex). For functions such
/as protein binding or nucleic acid binding, a binding assay is
/simultaneously IPI and IDA; IDA is preferred because the assay
/directly detects the binding. For both IPI and IGI, it would be good
/practice to qualify them with the gene/protein/ion. 
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-EXP-IDA
TYPES - EV-EXP
COMMON-NAME - Inferred from direct assay
COMMENT - IDA inferred from direct assay.<br>
/The assertion was inferred from a direct experimental assay such as

/    <li> Immunofluorescence
/    <li> Cell fractionation
/</ul>
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-COMP-HINF
TYPES - EV-COMP
COMMON-NAME - Inferred by a human based on computational evidence
COMMENT - Human inference.  A curator or author inferred this assertion after review of one or more possible types 
/of computational evidence such as sequence similarity, recognized motifs or consensus sequence, etc.  
/When the inference was made by a computer in an automated fashion, use EV-AINF.
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-COMP-AINF
TYPES - EV-COMP
COMMON-NAME - Inferred computationally without human oversight
COMMENT - Automated inference.  A computer inferred this assertion through one of many possible methods such as 
/sequence similarity, recognized motifs or consensus sequence, etc.  When a person made the inference 
/from computational evidence, use EV-HINF
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-COMP-IBA
TYPES - EV-COMP
COMMON-NAME - Inferred from Biological aspect from Ancestor
COMMENT - A type of phylogenetic evidence whereby an aspect of a descendent is inferred through the characterization of an aspect of a ancestral gene.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Transcription-Initiation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription
//
UNIQUE-ID - Transcriptional-Attenuation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription
COMMENT - This class describes the regulation of gene expression by transcription attenuation, or the premature termination of transcription.
/In all cases, the regulated-entity will be a terminator, although if precise terminator information is unknown then this frame may 
/alternatively be linked to a transcription-unit or gene.  When a terminator is specified, only genes in a transcription-unit that lie 
/downstream from the regulated terminator will have their expression regulated by instances of this class.
/
/Even though the regulated-entity may be a terminator, the value of the MODE slot refers to the overall effect on gene expression.
/Thus, a regulator that blocks termination at a terminator is considered an activator, and the value of the MODE slot will be "+",
/while a regulator that promotes termination is a repressor, with a value of "-" for the MODE slot.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Compound-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMON-NAME - Small-Molecule-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a small molecule directly activates or inhibits translation of the mRNA without requiring the mediation of a regulatory protein.  
/Typically, a region of the mRNA transcript (recorded in the slot Associated-Binding-Site) acts as a riboswitch or ribosensor and binds the regulating 
/molecule directly.  This induces a change in mRNA secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site, or interferes in some other 
/way with the translation initiation process.  Alternatively, the small molecule can act by causing or preventing the targeting of the transcript for 
/degradation, or by translational attenuation, interacting with the ribosome to cause or prevent premature termination of translation.  The Mode slot records
/the specific regulation mechanism, if known.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will generally be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript whose
/translation is being regulated (although it is also possible for the regulated entity to be an individual gene).  The regulator will be a small molecule.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a regulatory protein activates or inhibits translation of the mRNA.   The protein can directly interfere with translation initiation
/by binding to the mRNA transcript (at a location recorded in the slot Associated-Binding-Site) and either directly blocking the ribosome binding site, or
/by inducing a change in secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site or interferes in some other way with the translation initiation
/pathway.  Alternatively, the protein can process the transcript in some way to cause or prevent its targeting for degradation.  A third option is that by 
/translational attenuation, the protein can interact with the ribosome to cause or prevent premature termination of translation.  The Mode slot records the 
/specific regulation mechanism, if known.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will generally be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript whose 
/translation is being regulated (although it is also possible for the regulated entity to be a gene).  The regulator will be a protein.
//
UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a small regulatory RNA binds to a roughly complementary region on the mRNA transcript (specified
/in slot Associated-Binding-Site), possibly with the aid of one or more chaperones or accessory proteins (specified in slot
/Accessory-Proteins), to regulate translation.  Regulation may be by directly interfering with translation (for example,
/by directly blocking or by inducing some change in secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site), by
/causing (or preventing) the mRNA to be targeted for degradation, or by some combination of the two.  The Mechanism slot
/is used to indicate which of the above two mechanisms of action are involved, if known.  If a specific RNAse is specified
/in slot Associated-RNAse, then the sRNA targets the mRNA to be degraded by that particular RNAse.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript
/whose translation is being regulated.  The regulator will be an sRNA.

UNIQUE-ID - Complex-Processes
TYPES - Reactions-Classified-By-Conversion-Type
COMMENT - Each instance of this class represents a complex, multistep, black-box process.  Details of the process may or may not
/actually be known, but are not described in this frame.  Therefore, the entire process is considered to be a black box that
/we cannot see within.  Examples of processes that might be represented in this manner are protein degradation,
/transcription and translation.  When it is not clear whether a given transition is caused by a single reaction or
/by a complex process, use Unknown-Conversions.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Simple-Reactions
TYPES - Reactions-Classified-By-Conversion-Type
COMMENT - An instance of this class should be a single reaction involving only a small number of defined participants, 
/in contrast to large complicated processes that can be better classified under the Complex-Processes
/class (e.g., transcription or translation).  Simple-Reactions should be considered indivisible at the current level of abstraction,
/but it is possible to define a decomposition of a simple reaction into a lower level set of sub-reactions, that
/exist at a different level of abstraction.  Simple-Reactions are therefore simple in comparison to
/Complex-Processes, not because they cannot be decomposed.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Unknown-Conversions
TYPES - Reactions-Classified-By-Conversion-Type
COMMENT - Instances of this class define conversions for which it is not known whether the transformation
/occurs as a complex process or as a single reaction step.  An example is the conversion
/of an inactive form of a protein to an active form, when the exact chemical forms of the protein, and the nature 
/of the transition from one form to the other are not known.  For transformations that are known
/to be multistep, use Complex-Processes class instead.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Interconversion
TYPES - Activation-Inactivation-Interconversion
COMMON-NAME - Interconversions
COMMENT - This class contains interconversion pathways. These pathways describe the
/bidirectional conversion of a bio-molecule to a different form. The forward and
/backward conversions often result in significant changes in the biological activity
/of the compound, thus resulting in its activation and deactivation, respectively.
/
/Interconversion pathways are different from biosynthetic or degradative cyclic
/pathways in the fact that they lack an input and/or output flux. For example, the
/purpose of the |FRAME: CALVIN-PWY "Calvin Cycle"|, which is a biosynthetic cycle, is CO<sub>2</sub>
/fixation. As the cycle turns there is a net input of carbon dioxide and net output
/of fructose 6-phosphate. In the interconversion pathway |FRAME:PWY-2345|, on
/the other hand, the purpose of the cycle is simply to convert the compounds
/genistein, genistin and malonylgenistin to each other in a reversible manner.
//

/their biological activity. These modifications may be either reversible or irreversible.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Activation
TYPES - Activation-Inactivation-Interconversion
COMMON-NAME - Activation
COMMENT - This class contains activation pathways. In contrast to standard biosynthesis

/been observed.  They are maintained in the database to maintain a
/record of their past versus current status.
/
//

/ontology developed by M. Riley.  Genes whose function is unknown or known
/only approximately are assigned to the subclasses ORFs and Unclassified-Genes,
/respectively.  GO (Gene Ontology) assignments are implemented using the 
/GO-TERMS slot within gene products.

/binds to RNA-Polymerase, changing its promoter preference, and thus regulating transcription initiation.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Transcription-Factor-Binding
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription-Initiation
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe regulation of transcription initiation whereby the binding of an RNA-polymerase to
/a transcription unit promoter is activated or inhibited by the binding of some entity (generally a transcription factor) to some nearby
/DNA binding site.  The regulator in this case is the transcription factor, and the regulated-entity is the transcription unit promoter
/(although what is really being regulated is the transcription of the transcription unit to produce RNA).  If no promoter has been identified
/for a transcription unit, or no transcription unit for a regulated gene, it is possible to specify the transcription unit or the gene itself as the 
/regulated-entity instead of the promoter, although it is understood that these cases describe incomplete information.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, an RNA-binding protein will interact with the nascent transcript in order
/to determine which of two competing RNA stem-loop structures form: a terminator (thereby terminating transcription)
/or an antiterminator (thereby allowing transcription to continue).  When acting as an activator, the protein
/stabilizes the antiterminator, preventing terminator formation.  When acting as an inhibitor, the protein
/blocks antiterminator formation, allowing terminator formation.  The regulator in these cases is the
/RNA-binding protein and the regulated-entity is the terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the attenuator consists of two competing stem-loop structures in the mRNA: an 
/antiterminator, which allows further transcription, and a terminator, which ends it.  An RNA pairs with a 
/region on the leader transcript to either stabilize or block the formation of an antiterminator, thus preventing 
/or allowing formation of the competing terminator, and consequently activating or inhibiting transcription.  
/Examples include the binding of an uncharged tRNA to a T box region on the leader transcript to stabilize an 
/antiterminator, or the pairing of an antisense RNA with its complementary strand to block antiterminator formation.  
/The regulator in these cases is an RNA and the regulated-entity is the terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Polymerase-Modification
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, a regulatory protein binds to a site in a transcription unit and interacts with
/RNA polymerase, such that the modified RNA polymerase is no longer sensitive to termination signals, 
/and transcription continues past one or more terminators.  The regulator is the regulatory protein and the 
/regulated-entity is a terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Rho-Blocking-Antitermination
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - Rho-dependent termination requires binding of the Rho hexamer upstream of terminator sites in a nascent transcript.
/In this class of attenuation, a regulator molecule causes the ribosome to stall adjacent to the Rho-factor
/binding site.  This prevents Rho from binding, thereby preventing Rho-dependent termination, and
/transcription continues.The regulator in this case is the regulator molecule, generally a protein, and the 
/regulated-entity is the Rho-dependent terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Ribosome-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the intracellular level of a charged tRNA determines whether or not the ribosome
/pauses while synthesizing a leader peptide.  The pause site consists of a series of one or more codons for a 
/particular amino acid.  The ribosome, which moves sequentially along the transcript, synthesizing protein, must 
/wait for a tRNA charged with that amino acid before it can proceed further.  Thus, the intracellular level
/of that amino acid determines how much charged tRNA is available, and therefore whether or not the 
/ribosome pauses.  The newly forming mRNA transcript can adopt one of two competing stem-loop conformations, a
/terminator or an antiterminator structure.  In all cases described so far, pausing favors the formation of
/an antiterminator structure, thus preventing terminator formation, and allowing gene expression.  The regulator
/in this case will be the particular charged tRNA, and the regulated-entity is the terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Small-Molecule-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the mRNA leader transcript can bind directly to small molecule ligands
/(the mRNA region in this case is also known as a riboswitch).  This binding determines which of two
/mutually exclusive RNA structures forms, a terminator or an antiterminator.  If the small molecule
/blocks antiterminator formation and thereby promotes terminator formation, it will inhibit transcription.  
/If it promotes antiterminator formation, it activates transcription beyond the terminator region.

COMMENT - Note that this term and its child terms are intended for receptors that are directly coupled to a signal transduction pathway. This term should therefore not be used to annotate decoy receptors and other proteins that bind a signal but do not pass the signal on. This term can be used to annotate dependence receptors that transduce a signal when a ligand is withdrawn (in this case, signal withdrawal is considered to be the initiating signal), or receptors that signal at a basal level in the absence of a bound agonist. For receptors that mediate transport of a substance into the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis, consider instead the term 'cargo receptor activity ; GO:0038024' and its children.

COMMENT - Nitriles are <b>organic</b> compounds that contain a functional group of a carbon atom linked by a triple bond to a nitrogen atom (known as a cyano group). Inorganic compounds that contain the cyano group are not called nitriles, but cyanides.
/
/The first nitrile to be synthesized (in 1782 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele) was that of formate, |FRAME: HCN|, which is an extremely toxic compound (it is an inhibitor of |FRAME: EC-1.9.3.1|). The name nitrile originates from the nitrile of benzoate, |FRAME: CPD-15582|, which was synthesized in 1844 by Hermann Fehling. Fehling named the compound nitrile, and the name was subsequently applied for all organic compounds that contain a cyano group.
/
/Nitriles occur naturally in many organisms, and over 120 naturally occurring nitriles have been isolated. It is particularly common in fruit seeds. The cyano group is very stable and is not readily metabolized.

COMMENT - Steroids are compounds possessing the skeleton of cyclopenta[<i>a</i>]phenanthrene or a skeleton derived
/therefrom by one or more bond scissions or ring expansions or contractions. Methyl groups are normally present
/at C-10 and C-13. An alkyl side chain may also be present at C-17.
/
/Steroids are abundant in the environment. Large amounts of steroids and their derivatives are synthesized by eukaryotes, and these molecules play very important and diverse roles and include hormones, detergents that facilitate the absorption of lipids by the intestine, and membrane constituents. Some of them, |FRAME: CHOLESTEROL| and related compounds, are ubiquitous as membrane constituent of eukaryotes (for instance, up to 10% of the dry mass of yeast is |FRAME: ERGOSTEROL|) and as the precursors of all steroid hormones, vitamin D, and the bile acids.
/
/Interestingly, with exception of methane-oxidizing bacteria that contain relatively large amounts of sterols, sterols are absent from most prokaryotes. However, many bacterial membranes contain |FRAME: Hopanoids hopanoids|, which are similar pentacyclic sterol-like molecules |CITS: [18039763]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Poly-Gamma-Glutamates
TYPES - Compounds
COMMON-NAME - poly-&gamma;-glutamate
COMMENT - Poly-&gamma;-glutamate (PGA) is a natural polymer that is synthesized by several bacteria (all Gram-positive), archaea and (so far) one eukaryote (|FRAME: TAX-6073|). PGA has diverse biochemical properties, enabling it to play different roles, depending on the organism and its environment. Pathogens such as |FRAME: TAX-1392| use it to produce a capsule that protects them from host defense systems |CITS: [2984311]|. Soil bacteria use released PGA for the sequestration of toxic metal ions |CITS: [16348371]|. The bacteria |FRAME: TAX-1371| and |FRAME: TAX-1570|, as well as the archaeon |FRAME: TAX-64602| (the only archaea known to produce PGA) use it to decrease high local salt concentrations |CITS: [Kandler83][11411682]|. |FRAME: TAX-6073| use PGA to trigger the explosion of nematocysts, stringing cells used to capture prey, for locomotion and for defence |CITS: [1693614]|.
/
/PGA was first described in |FRAME: TAX-1392| at the start of the 20th Century. This organism produces a capsule that is composed solely of PGA. The capsule enables the bacteria to escape phagocytosis, and therefore acts as a virulence factor. The |FRAME: TAX-1392| capsule is composed exclusively of the D enantiomer, making it non-immunogenic. However, other bacteria may produce PGA that contains either only D, only L, or a mixture of the two |CITS: [16689787]|.

UNIQUE-ID - CPD-12378
TYPES - Compounds
COMMON-NAME - melanochrome
COMMENT - Spectroscopic studies of the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-12379| showed that it takes place in three chromophoric phases.
/The first phase corresponds to the formation of a red pigment (&lambda;max 475 nm), |FRAME: L-DOPACHROME|. The second phase corresponds to a purple intermediate, which was designated |FRAME: CPD-12378|, with a broad absorption maximum at 540 nm, and the third phase is characterized by a general absorption due to |FRAME: CPD-12379| |CITS: [Napolitano85]|.
/
/Chemical analysis of |FRAME: CPD-12378| suggests that it is composed of different oligomers (mostly dimers and trimers)
/of |FRAME: DIHYDROXYINDOLE| (DHI) and |FRAME: 56-DIHYDROXYINDOLE-2-CARBOXYLATE| linked by 2-4' and 2-7' linkages |CITS: [Prota91]|.

UNIQUE-ID - FeS-Cluster-Co-Chaperones
TYPES - Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an [Fe-S cluster biosynthesis co-chaperone]
COMMENT - Two chaperone proteins have been shown to play an important role in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters. The two proteins, which were named chaperone and co-chaperone, are involved in the later part of the process, following the formation of an [2Fe-2S] cluster on the scaffold protein, and help in the transfer of the cluster from the scaffold protein to a recepient <i>apo</i>-iron-sulfur protein.
/
/The |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Co-Chaperones co-chaperone| acts first, by binding to |FRAME: CD-SP-2Fe2S-Complex| (a protein complex that includes |FRAME: L-Cysteine-Desulfurases| and |FRAME: Iron-Sulfur-Cluster-Scaffold-Proteins| with an already-assembled [2Fe-2S] cluster), displacing the cysteine desulfurase and forming |FRAME: Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex|.
/
/The co-chaperone guides this complex to the other |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Chaperones-ATP chaperone| (an ATPase protein with a pre-bound ATP molecule), where it binds to a nucleotide-binding domain, forming |FRAME: Chap-ATP-Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex "a ternary complex"|.
/
/At this point the complex is ready to transfer its [2Fe2S] cluster to a receipient. When a suitable acceptor protein approaches the complex one or two of its thiol groups attack the cluster's iron atoms, liberating one or two of the scaffold protein cluster ligands and leading to a conformational change in the co-chaperone that activates the ATPase activity of the main chaperone. Cleavage of the bound ATP leads to an additional conformational change that results in a fundumental change |CITS: [11053447][15485839]|.  A binding site on the ligand binding domain of the chaperone protein opens up and binds the scaffold protein in its disordered state. The conversion of the scaffold protein to its disordered state releases both the Fe-S cluster, which moves to the acceptor protein, and the co-chaperone. 
/
/This is followed by an exchange of the bound ADP for ATP, which restores the chaperone to its active state and releases the scaffold protein, both of which become ready to take part in the next cycle |CITS: [23333622]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Peroxiredoxins
TYPES - Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a peroxiredoxin
COMMENT - Peroxiredoxins are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant enzymes which have been identified in eubacteria,
/archaea, yeast, algae, higher plants, and animals |CITS: [12714747]|.
/All peroxiredoxins share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which an activated cysteine
/(the peroxidative cysteine) is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate.
/They have a rather low activity, but possess a broad substrate specificity.
/Substrates for peroxiredoxins include hydrogen peroxides, alkyl hydroperoxides, and peroxynitrites.
/
/Reductive regeneration of the oxidized catalytic thiol depends on glutathione, thioredoxin, glutaredoxin,
/cyclophilin, and/or tryparedoxin |CITS: [16284092]|.
/
/In plants, peroxiredoxins are categorized into four subclasses based on subunit composition, number
/and location of the conserved cysteine residues, and the sequence environment of the catalytic center.
/The four types are:
/
/1. |FRAME: 2-Cys-Peroxiredoxins|: these peroxiredoxins contain two conserved cysteines and are
/homodimeric enzymes where the two subunits interact in the catalytic cycle and are linked via a
/disulfide bond in the oxidized form. Eukaryotic 2-Cys proxiredoxins, which are exclusively localized
/in the chloroplast, are also shown to regulate H2O2-mediated signal transduction |CITS: [9263459]|.
/
/2. |FRAME: 1-Cys-Peroxiredoxins|: these contain a single conserved catalytic cysteine and are
/preferentially expressed in plants in the embryo and aleurone |CITS: [8914536]|.
/
/3. |FRAME: Type-II-Peroxiredoxins| (also known as atypical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins): these can use
/thioredoxin and glutaredoxin as the reductant and can exist in multiple isoforms localized in plants in
/many subcellular compartments, including one form in plastids |CITS: [12913160]|.
/
/4. |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins| ((also known as atypical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins): these are
/homologues of the E. coli bacterioferritin co-migrating protein and function as monomers
/|CITS: [10998352]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Non-ribosomal-peptide-synthetases
TYPES - Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase
COMMENT - The biosynthetic system for the production of |FRAME: Nonribosomal-Peptides| operates nucleic
/acid-free at the protein level.
/The specific condensation of amino acids and related carboxyl containing compounds is directed by
/protein templates, and each biosynthetic step generally requires a protein module.
/A minimal configuration consists of an adenylation domain for amino acid activation, a thiolation domain
/for transfer of activated intermediates, and a condensation domain.
/
/Domains and modules are assembled at the gene level into gene clusters, which are translated into
/multifunctional proteins or multi-enzyme complexes, and post-translationally modified by addition of
/|FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| to the thiolation domain |CITS: [16774586]|.
/
/Since a minimal module requires 33.5 kbp of genetic sequence, and since most non-ribosomal peptide
/synthetases (NRPSs) consist of several such modules, some NRPS genes are the largest known genes
/|CITS: [15487945]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Binding-Reactions
TYPES - Simple-Reactions
COMMENT - This class consists of reactions in which no covalent modification of the substrates takes place, but in which the net effect is that one substrate

/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Redox-Half-Reactions
TYPES - Simple-Reactions
COMMENT - Redox half reactions are elementary reactions, in which explicitly
/stated electrons are reducing an oxidized molecular species.  These
/reactions do not stand alone, because electrons do not occur freely.
/Instead, a half reaction must be paired with another half reaction to
/form a complete, overall transformation.
/
/The convention adopted here is to write the half reactions always in
/the same direction, namely in the form:
/
/Ox. + e- --> Red.
/
/In other words, the oxidized species and the electrons are always in
/the LEFT slot, and the reduced species are always in the RIGHT slot.
/
/This reaction direction allows the standard reduction potential to be
/directly recorded in the STD-REDUCTION-POTENTIAL slot, such that
/reactions of this type are comparable with each other.

/
/AP sites can occur either spontaneously or due to DNA damage. It has been estimated that up to 10,000 apurinic sites may be generated in a cell each day |CITS: [2676144]|.
/
/AP sites are generated as intermediates during the DNA repair process known as base excision repair. The first step in that process is the cleavage of the damaged base by a DNA glycosylase, leaving an AP site.

COMMENT - Transmembrane transport requires transport of a solute across a lipid bilayer. Note that transport through the nuclear pore complex is not transmembrane because the nuclear membrane is a double membrane and is not traversed. For transport through the nuclear pore, consider instead the term 'nucleocytoplasmic transport ; GO:0006913' and its children. Note also that this term is not intended for use in annotating lateral movement within membranes.

COMMENT - Wall teichoic acids are a diverse group of peptidoglycan-linked, phosphate-rich polymers, found in the cell wall
/of Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [5411858][2496299]|. 
/In |FRAME: TAX-224308| the main form of teichoic acid is a polymer of poly-glycerol phosphate,
/while in |FRAME: TAX-655816| the major variety of teichoic acid is a polymer of poly-ribitol phosphate.
/In both cases, the repeating units are joined together by phosphodiester linkages.  It should be noted
/that strain 168 also possesses a minor form of wall teichoic acid, which is comprised of
/poly(glucosyl <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine 1-phosphate |CITS: [4202940]|). 
/Membrane teichoic acids, also known as lipoteichoic acids, are similar polymers of glycerol phosphate, but are
/linked to glycolipid molecules located in the cell membrane |CITS: [406922]|.
/Teichoic acids were first reported in 1958 |CITS: [Armstrong58]|, after being discovered serendipitously as
/"contaminants" in bacterial extracts from <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> |CITS: [2662967]|.
/
/Teichoic acids serve several roles in the cell. They serve as reservoirs of phosphates which can be mobilized
/when phosphate becomes limiting |CITS: [104966]|.  Being anionic, they are scavengers of cations (in particular
/Mg<sup>2+</sup>), and may create a pH gradient across the wall by sequestering the protons expelled through
/the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [8396121]|. In addition, lipoteichoic acids provide the main component of the
/hydrophobicity of the the cell envelope |CITS: [6337099]|, and may contribute to its adhesiveness. Teichoic
/acids are also immunogenic, and can be considered the Gram-positive equivalent of the Gram-negative
/lipopolysaccharides |CITS: [46620]|.

UNIQUE-ID - POLYKETIDE
TYPES - Secondary-Metabolites
COMMON-NAME - a polyketide
COMMENT - Polyketides are secondary metabolites produced by some bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
/Polyketides are usually biosynthesized by polyketide synthase enzymes (PKS) through the decarboxylative condensation of extender units that are derived from malonyl-CoA, in a process similar to fatty acid synthesis.
/
/PKSs can be divided to two types: multifunctional polyproteins (type I) and discrete protein (type II).
/Type I PKSs are organized into modular complexes, each catalyzing individual chain elongation steps using an associated carrier protein. The minimal type I PKS module consists of 3 domains: a ketosynthase, a acyltransferase, and an acyl-carrier protein (ACP). The acyltransferase domain catalyzes the priming of the flanking ACP domain with the appropriate substrate.
/
/Type II PKS ACPs, on the other hand, possess catalytic self-acylation activity |CITS: [18059524]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Ginsenosides
TYPES - Triterpenes
TYPES - Steroids
COMMON-NAME - a ginsenoside
COMMENT - |FRAME: Ginsenosides Ginsenosides| or panaxosides are a class of steroid glycosides and triterpene saponins found exclusively in the plant genus |FRAME: TAX-4053| (ginseng). They are the principal components responsible for the pharmaceutical activities of ginseng.
/
/Ginsenosides are composed of an aglycone and sugar moieties. Based on the structure of their aglycones, ginsenosides have been categorized into three broad types; |FRAME: Protopanaxadiol-type-ginsenosides "protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides"| (PPD), which contain hydroxyl groups at positions 3 and 20, |FRAME: Protopanaxatriol-type-ginsenosides "protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides"| (PPT), which contain hydroxyl groups at positions 3, 6 and 20, and |FRAME: Oleanonic-acid-type-ginsenosides "oleanonic-acid-type saponins"|.
/
/Although ginsenosides only have three kinds of aglycones, more than 60 kinds of ginsenosides have been identified by now due to the variability in the type of sugar moieties, their number, and the carbon positions they link to.
/
/The biological activity of ginsenoside increases with the decrease of the number of the sugar moieties. All of the ginsenosides found in large quantities in wild ginseng (known as major ginsenosides) are heavily glycosylated, while the more active less-glycosylated ginsenosides are found in much smalller quantities (and are commonly referred to as the
/minor ginsenosides). Following oral intake of ginseng, the large low-solubility and poor-permeability major ginsenosides cannot be absorbed by the human body directly |CITS: [Su06]|, and are deglycosylated into smaller forms in the gastrointestinal tract by intestinal bacteria and/or digestive enzymes |CITS: [8923812]|.
/
/Glycosidase enzymes that can convert the major ginsenosides to minor ginsenosides are not common and are of commercial interest.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Polyisoprenoids
TYPES - Lipids
COMMON-NAME - an isoprenoid
COMMENT - The nomenclature of isoprenoids and their derivatives is somewhat confusing. Here are some guidelines for understanding these names:
/
/Isoprenoids are composed of repeating isoprene units. The units can be attached in either a <i>trans</i> conformation (the two carbons are on opposite sides of the double bond) or a <i>cis</i> conformation (the two carbons are on the same side of the double bond). It is common to use <i>E</i> and <i>Z</i> instead of <i>trans</i> and <i>cis</i> , respectively.
/
/The numbering of carbons in the molecule starts from the carbon attached to the hydroxyl or phosphate group. The isoprene unit furthest from the C1 carbon is called the &omega; unit. Unlike all other isoprene units, the &omega; unit is not a stereo center since the last carbon is attached to two identical methyl groups.
/
/There are two widely used naming systems, and unfortunately they refer to the isoprene units in opposite order.
/According to one method, the molecule is described by the stereoconfiguration of the molecule starting with the &omega; unit. For example |FRAME:CPD-11977| is referred to as &omega;,<i>E,Z,Z</i> tetraprenyl diphosphate. 
/The other method describes the molecule starting with the unit with the lowest carbon number (ie the one furthest from the &omega; unit), naming each of the stereo-active carbons by its number, followed by its stereo designation. According to this method the same molecule is referred to as 2,6-<i>cis</i>,10-<i>trans</i>-tetraprenyl diphosphate or (2<i>Z</i>,6<i>Z</i>,10<i>E</i>)-tetraprenyl diphosphate.
/
/On top of this, many of the shorter molecules have trivial names that are commonly used. Some of these names are specific for a particular stereoisomer and some are used for all stereoisomer. 
/For example, |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP "geranylgeranyl diphosphate"| is commonly used for the all-<i>trans</i> isomer of the molecule with four isoprene units, while farnesyl diphosphate is used for all four isomers of the molecule with three isoprene units - |FRAME:FARNESYL-PP|, |FRAME:CPD-9444|, |FRAME:CPD-11293| and |FRAME:CPD-11990|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Phospholipids
TYPES - Lipids
COMMON-NAME - a phospholipid
COMMENT - Phospholipids are a class of phosphorous-containing lipids that are composed mainly of fatty acids, a phosphate group, and a backbone made of a simple organic molecule.
/
/Almost all of the phospholipids have a glycerol backbone. Such a phospholipid is known as |FRAME:Phosphoglycerides|.
/Some types of phospholipids, for example, |FRAME: Sphingomyelins|, have a backbone made of the amino-alcohol sphingosine.
/
/Phospholipids are a major component of all biological membranes.
//
UNIQUE-ID - SPHINGOLIPIDS
TYPES - Lipids
COMMON-NAME - a sphingolipid
COMMENT - Sphingolipids are a class of lipids derived from the unsaturated aliphatic amino alcohol |FRAME: SPHINGOSINE|. They are named for the mythological Sphinx because at the time (1884) their function was enigmatic |CITS: [Thudichum84]|.
/The sphingosine backbone (often referred to as the |FRAME: Sphingoids "sphingoid base"|) is amide-linked to an acyl group, such as a fatty acid, and is often also <i>O</i>-linked to a charged head group such as ethanolamine, serine, or choline. 
/
/There are three main types of sphingolipids: |FRAME: Ceramides ceramides|, |FRAME: Sphingomyelins sphingomyelins|, and |FRAME: Glycosphingolipids glycosphingolipids|. Ceramides are the most simple sphingolipids, composed of only the sphingoid base and a fatty acid. Sphingomyelins are composed of a ceramide bound to a charged head group, usually |FRAME: PHOSPHORYL-CHOLINE|. Glycosphingolipids are composed of a ceramide with attached mono- or oligosaccharide moieties.
/
/Mammals usually produce |FRAME: PHOSPHORYL-CHOLINE|-containing |FRAME: Sphingomyelins sphingomyelins|, while plants and fungi usually produce glycosphingolipids with inositol as the head group.

UNIQUE-ID - Wax-Esters
TYPES - Esters
COMMON-NAME - a wax ester
COMMENT - Natural waxes are biosynthesized by many plants and animals and are typically esters of fatty acids and long chain alcohols. The composition depends not only on species, but also on geographic location of the organism.

/within the same molecule. It is characterized by a closed ring consisting of two or more carbon atoms and a single oxygen atom, with a ketone group in one of the carbons adjacent to the ring oxygen.
/
/There are several types of lactones - |FRAME: Beta-lactones| contain 3 carbons in the ring,
/|FRAME:Gamma-lactones| contains 4, |FRAME:Delta-lactones| contains 5, and |FRAME:Epsilon-lactones|
/contains 6 carbons.
/
/The most stable structure for lactones are &gamma;-lactones and &delta;-lactones, because of the
/minimal angle strain in their structure. In fact, &gamma;-lactones are so stable that, in the presence of
/dilute acids at room temperature, 4-hydroxy acids esterify and cyclize spontaneously to form lactones.
/&beta;-lactones, on the other hand, are not very stable.

The fatty acid chains may be saturated, mono-unsaturated, or poly-unsaturated and the chain length may vary from C<sub>8</sub> to C<sub>16</sub>.  In rare cases the rhamnose 2-hydroxyl group distal to the glycosidic bond may be acylated with a long chain alkenoate. |CITS: [16160828] [20336292]|.

COMMENT - Elemental sulfur appears in a number of different allotropic modifications: rhombic, monoclinic, polymeric,
/and others. The rhombic structure is the most common.
/Both the rhombic and monoclinic forms of sulfur are made up of eight sulfur atoms arranged in a
/puckered-ring structure. At one atmosphere pressure and temperatures less than 95.4°C, rhombic is the
/stable crystalline form. Above 95.4 °C to the melt temperature of 118.9 °C, the monoclinic crystalline
/structure is dominant |CITS: [Steudel00]|.
/
/In addition, elemental sulfur always contains some polymeric sulfur consisting of chain-like
/macromolecules. The S-S bond energy is lower in polymeric sulfur than in ring sulfur |CITS: [17379736]|.

TYPES - Protein-Complexes
COMMON-NAME - a [co-chaperone]-[scaffold protein-(2Fe-2S)] complex
COMMENT - Two chaperone proteins have been shown to play an important role in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters. The two proteins, which were named chaperone and co-chaperone, are involved in the later part of the process, following the formation of an [2Fe-2S] cluster on the scaffold protein, and help in the transfer of the cluster from the scaffold protein to a recepient <i>apo</i>-iron-sulfur protein.
/
/The |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Co-Chaperones co-chaperone| acts first, by binding to |FRAME: CD-SP-2Fe2S-Complex| (a protein complex that includes |FRAME: L-Cysteine-Desulfurases| and |FRAME: Iron-Sulfur-Cluster-Scaffold-Proteins| with an already-assembled [2Fe-2S] cluster), displacing the cysteine desulfurase and forming |FRAME: Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex|.
/
/The co-chaperone guides this complex to the other |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Chaperones-ATP chaperone| (an ATPase protein with a pre-bound ATP molecule), where it binds to a nucleotide-binding domain, forming |FRAME: Chap-ATP-Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex "a ternary complex"|.
/
/At this point the complex is ready to transfer its [2Fe2S] cluster to a receipient. When a suitable acceptor protein approaches the complex one or two of its thiol groups attack the cluster's iron atoms, liberating one or two of the scaffold protein cluster ligands and leading to a conformational change in the co-chaperone that activates the ATPase activity of the main chaperone. Cleavage of the bound ATP leads to an additional conformational change that results in a fundumental change |CITS: [11053447][15485839]|.  A binding site on the ligand binding domain of the chaperone protein opens up and binds the scaffold protein in its disordered state. The conversion of the scaffold protein to its disordered state releases both the Fe-S cluster, which moves to the acceptor protein, and the co-chaperone. 
/
/This is followed by an exchange of the bound ADP for ATP, which restores the chaperone to its active state and releases the scaffold protein, both of which become ready to take part in the next cycle |CITS: [23333622]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Phosphatase-2A
TYPES - Protein-Complexes
COMMON-NAME - a phosphatase-2A
COMMENT - Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) removes the serine- or threonine-bound phosphate group from a wide range of phosphoproteins. The enzyme is very versatile owing to a large number of regulatory subunits and its ability to interact with numerous other proteins. The PP2A holoenzyme is a dimeric or trimeric protein built up from a catalytic subunit (PP2AC) (catalytic subunit of PP2A), a second constant regulatory subunit, and a third variable subunit. Three major classes of third subunits are currently described. Each of the three subunits of PP2A exists in at least two isoforms, thereby leading to a great variety of possible holoenzyme conformations, all with potential different substrate affinities and catalytic activities.
/
/The common heterodimeric core of the human enzyme consists of |FRAME: HS03696-MONOMER PPP2CA|, a 36 kDa catalytic subunit, and |FRAME: ENSG00000105568-MONOMER PPP2R1A|, a 65 kDa constant regulatory subunit.

UNIQUE-ID - Hydrogenases
TYPES - Protein-Complexes
COMMON-NAME - a hydrogenase
COMMENT - This class of proteins represents any hydrogenase that has been activated.
/
/<b>General Background </b>
/
/Hydrogenases catalyze the reversible interconversion of protons, electrons and  |FRAME:HYDROGEN-MOLECULE|, resulting in |FRAME:HYDROGEN-MOLECULE| oxidation to two protons or in the reverse direction, molecular hydrogen production by the reduction of protons.
/
/Most hydrogenases are metalloenzymes that contain iron-sulfur clusters. They have been subdivided into two main classes based on the composition of two metal atoms at their active center: [NiFe] hydrogenases and [FeFe] hydrogenases. These two classes are phylogenetically distinct. It should be noted that in some of the [NiFe] hydrogenases one of the Ni-bound cysteine residues is replaced by selenocysteine. Those enzymes are known as [NiFeSe] hydrogenases. The [FeFe] hydrogenases usually have high catalytic activity, but are sensitive to irreversible inactivation by |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE|, more so than [NiFe] hydrogenases. 
/
/While [FeFe] hydrogenases are limited to certain bacteria and a few unicellular eukaryotes, [NiFe] hydrogenases are widespread in both bacteria and archaea |CITS: [20463892]|. 
/
/ [NiFe] hydrogenases are usually heterodimeric proteins, but can be associated with additional subunits.The large subunit contains the [NiFe] catalytic site, while the smaller subunit contains 3 FeS clusters.  These clusters transfer electrons from an external electron donor to the [NiFe] site for reduction of protons |CITS: [20463892]|.
/Many [FeFe]-hydrogenases are monomeric but possess additional domains that contain FeS clusters |CITS: [18500479]|. The catalytic core of [FeFe] hydrogenases is a single domain of about 350 residues that accommodates the active site known as the H cluster.
/
/In addition, a third class of hydrogenases is found in some methanogenic archaea. These enzymes contain only a mononuclear Fe active site and no FeS clusters, and are known as [Fe] hydrogenases.

COMMENT - NovH (and its homologs) is the first enzyme in the bioynthesis of the 7-hydroxy-2-aminocoumarin core of antibiotics such as novobiocin, clorobiocin, and coumermycin A1.
/
/NovH contains an adenylation (A) domain and a thiolation (T) domain, similat to initiation modules in nonribosomal peptide synthetase assembly lines. The A domain of NovH activates |FRAME: TYR| to tyrosine-AMP and then covalently tethers the aminoacyl moiety to the thiol of a phosphopantetheine prosthetic group in the T domain, yielding tyrosyl-S-NovH. All subsequent modifications leading to formation of the aminocoumarin core occur on this covalently tethered entity. Free tyrosine is not a substrate for the next enzyme (NovI) |CITS: [16171397]|.

TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - an opsin
COMMENT - The opsin proteins are the retinal-binding visual pigments found in the photoreceptor cells in the retinas of mammalian eyes.
/An opsin is arranged into a bundle of seven transmembrane &alpha;-helices connected by six loops. In rod cells the opsin molecules are embedded in the membranes of the disks which are entirely inside of the cell.  In cone cells the disks are defined by the cell's plasma membrane so that the N-terminus head extends outside of the cell. 
/
/|FRAME: CPD-881| binds covalently to a lysine on the transmembrane helix nearest the C-terminus of opsin through a Schiff base linkage. Formation of the Schiff base linkage involves removing the oxygen atom from retinal and two hydrogen atoms from the free amino group of lysine, releasing a water molecule.
/
/While mammals use retinal exclusively as the opsin chromophore, other groups of animals additionally use four chromophores closely related to retinal, including (3,4)-didehydroretinal (many fish and amphibians), (3R)-3-hydroxyretinal (most insects), (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal (Cyclorrhaphans), and (4R)-4-hydroxyretinal (Firefly squid).

UNIQUE-ID - Sulfurylated-ThiI
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - an <i>S</i>-sulfanyl-[ThiI sulfur-carrier protein]
COMMENT - ThiI is a bifunctional enzyme that is required both for the synthesis of the thiazole moiety of thiamine and for the conversion of uridine to 4-thiouridine at position 8 in tRNA |CITS: [6178725][9592144]|.
/The protein contains several domains, and different domains are involved in tRNA modification and thiazole formation. The THUMP and AANH domains are required for tRNA modification, while the only domain necessary for thiozole formation is the C-terminal rhodanese domain (as shown for the enzyme from Salmonella |CITS: [21724998]|).
/
/Regarding thiazole biosynthesis, it has been shown that the thiI gene plays an essential role in the formation of a thiocarboxylate on the carboxylic acid group of the carboxyl-terminal glycine of the ThiS protein. ThiS isolated
/from a thiI-defficient strain does not contain this modification |CITS: [9632726]|.
/
/Regarding uridine modification, the enzyme adenylates the tRNA uridine and transfers sulfur from a persulfide formed on the protein. It is specific for the U8 residue of tRNA; the substrate specificity appears to be conferred by the secondary and tertiary structure of tRNA |CITS: [15037613]|.
/The ThiI protein, but not the IscS protein, was shown to interact with tRNA.  <i>In vitro</i> studies using radiolabelled sulfur showed transfer of sulfur from IscS to ThiI; if tRNA is included, the sulfur appears to be incorporated into the tRNA in a ThiI- and ATP-dependent manner.  Based on these results, a model for mobilization and transfer of sulfur from cysteine via IscS and ThiI to U8 of tRNA has been presented |CITS: [10753862]|.

/
/Retinochrome is synthesized in the |FRAME: Apo-Retinochromes "<i>apo</i> form"|. The active retinochrome is produced by the reversibly covalent binding of |FRAME: RETINAL|. Isomerization of |FRAME: RETINAL| into |FRAME: CPD-881| by light (while bound to the protein) induces a conformational change, resulting in the |FRAME: Metaretinochromes metaretinochrome| form.

COMMENT - The small subunits of MPT synthases from different organisms (such as the bacterial MoaD protein) contain a double glycine motif at the C terminus. The free carboxylate group of the terminal glycine is activated by an accessory protein (MoeB in bacteria, MOCS3 in humans and Cnx5 in plants) to a carboxy-adenylate form, which is then sulfurylated by a sulfurase (|FRAME: CPLX0-248 IscS| in bacteria, the rhodanese-like domain of molybdopterin synthase sulfurylase in eukaryotes), resulting in a thiocarboxylate. Each small subunit in the complex donates the sulfur atom of the thiocarboxylate to |FRAME: PRECURSOR-Z|, resulting in formation of |FRAME: CPD-4| |CITS: [11459846]|.

UNIQUE-ID - FeS-Proteins

TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an iron-sulfur protein
COMMENT - Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins contain iron atom(s) ligated by inorganic sulfide and/or at least two cysteinyl (Cys) ligands. The main function of the Fe-S active sites is electron transfer, mostly in the range of low oxidation-reduction potentials. 
/In addition to their roles in electron transfer reactions, iron-sulfur proteins are also known to participate in the activation of substrates, the stabilization of radicals and structures, the protection of proteins from enzymes and the storage of iron and sulfur. In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate in regulation of gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|. Fe-S active sites are perhaps the most ancient cofactors.
/
/The simplest Fe-S proteins contain a mononuclear thiolate complex [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>, as it occurs in |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. However, in the great majority of Fe-S proteins the iron is present in clusters, with the iron linked by sulfides.
/
/Several cluster types have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-6|, |FRAME: CPD-23|, |FRAME: 3FE-4S| and |FRAME: CPD-7|. The [3Fe-4S] cluster is relatively rare, and 3Fe/4Fe interconversion may occur with minimal protein reorganization. In another type of Fe-S cluster, known as |FRAME: CPD0-1098|, two of the 4 cysteine residues are substituted by histidine residues. Although the clusters contain several iron atoms, each one usually transfers only one electron, so, for example, a protein with two [4Fe-4S] clusters will usually transfer two electrons.
/
/As mentioned above, small electron transfer proteins that contain only mononuclear [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> complexes are called |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. Small electron transfer proteins that contain only [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters are called |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|. When Fe-S clusters occur in larger (and sometimes membrane-bound) proteins together with other prosthetic groups and/or metal cofactors, the proteins are designated as complex Fe-S proteins. 
/
/Many complex Fe-S proteins contain multiple clusters arranged in chains, separated 1 - 1.4 nm apart, which allow electron transfer across considerable distances. Other electron-transferring groups such as heme or flavin may also be present. Examples include the electron transport chains of mitochondrial respiration (|FRAME: EC-1.6.5.3 "complex I"|, |FRAME: EC-1.3.5.1 "complex II"| and |FRAME: EC-1.10.2.2 "complex III"|) and photosynthesis (|FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12 "photosystem I"|), and enzymes such as |FRAME: EC-1.12.1.2 hydrogenase|, |FRAME: EC-1.18.6.1 nitrogenase| and |FRAME: EC-1.17.1.4 "xanthine dehydrogenase"|.
/
/Some enzymes with |FRAME: CPD-7 "4Fe-4S clusters"| are able to achieve unusual reducing power utilizing hydrolysis of MgATP. In these proteins the [4Fe-4S] cluster is located between two subunits of a protein, each contributing two Cys ligands, and each binding one molecule of ATP which is hydrolyzed during electron transfer. These proteins achieve reductions requiring potential differences of more than 1 V.
/
/It should be noted that in enzymes that utilize Fe-S clusters not for electron transfer but directly in catalysis, such as |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.3 aconitase| and radical SAM enzymes, one of iron atoms is free (rather than ligated to an amino acid) and can bind the substrate directly.

UNIQUE-ID - Glutaredoxins
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a glutaredoxin
COMMENT - Glutaredoxins are small redox proteins of the TRX superfamily using glutathione (GSH) as electron donor. Like thioredoxins they reduce intracellular disulfides, but they are much more efficient than thioredoxins in catalyzing protein deglutathionylation by reduction of protein-GSH mixed disulfides |CITS:[12682041]|. The glutaredoxins seem to play a major role in oxidative stress responses and iron-sulfur cluster assembly .
/
/Glutaredoxins have been divided into three classes - the "classical" dithiol proteins, monothiol proteins, and GST-related dithiol proteins. The classical dithiol glutaredoxins contain two cysteine residues, usually in a CPYC active-site motif; while the monothiol glutaredoxins contain a single cysteine found in a CGFS motif in the active site. The third group includes atypical glutaredoxins, which are very similar to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) proteins, but incorporate the CPYC motif |CITS: [11898418]|. More recently a fourth group of glutaredoxins has been described in higher plants. Proteins in this group include a CCXC or CCXS active-site motif |CITS: [17089213]|.
/
/Glutaredoxins can use a dithiol mechanism similar to that employed by thioredoxins. However, unlike thioredoxins glutaredoxins can utilize the thiols from GSH in solution together with the glutaredoxin N-terminal cysteine in a mechanism that is called the monothiol mechanism.

UNIQUE-ID - Thioredoxin
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a thioredoxin
COMMENT - Thioredoxins are small redox proteins known to be present in nearly all organisms and function in a wide variety of cellular processes. 
/
/Thioredoxins have a characteristic tertiary structure known as the thioredoxin fold, and contain two vicinal cysteines in a CXXC motif. These two cysteines form the cysteine disulfide/dithiol active site, and allow thioredoxin to reduce other proteins.
/
/The thioredoxins are kept in the reduced state by the flavoenzyme |FRAME: THIOREDOXIN-REDUCT-NADPH-CPLX|, which utilizes NADPH as the electron source. The conversion between the oxidized and reduced forms results in a change of conformation and a significant change in functional properties. The reduced thioredoxin is a powerful protein disulfide reductase that catalyzes dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions with many substrates. In addition, thioredoxins can also act as electron donors to certain proteins, such as the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: DSBD-MONOMER|.
/
/|FRAME: Glutaredoxins Glutaredoxins| share many of the functions of thioredoxins, but are reduced by glutathione rather than a specific reductase. 
/
/The oxidized form of thioredoxin has been crystallized, the reduced form has been solved by NMR |CITS: [6378624][3896121][3152490][2187529] [2193685] [8098620] [2181145]|.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Sulfur-Carrier-Proteins-ThiI
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a ThiI sulfur-carrier protein
COMMENT - ThiI is a bifunctional enzyme that is required both for the synthesis of the thiazole moiety of thiamine and for the conversion of uridine to 4-thiouridine at position 8 in tRNA |CITS: [6178725][9592144]|.
/The protein contains several domains, and different domains are involved in tRNA modification and thiazole formation. The THUMP and AANH domains are required for tRNA modification, while the only domain necessary for thiozole formation is the C-terminal rhodanese domain (as shown for the enzyme from Salmonella |CITS: [21724998]|).
/
/Regarding thiazole biosynthesis, it has been shown that the thiI gene plays an essential role in the formation of a thiocarboxylate on the carboxylic acid group of the carboxyl-terminal glycine of the ThiS protein. ThiS isolated
/from a thiI-defficient strain does not contain this modification |CITS: [9632726]|.
/
/Regarding uridine modification, the enzyme adenylates the tRNA uridine and transfers sulfur from a persulfide formed on the protein. It is specific for the U8 residue of tRNA; the substrate specificity appears to be conferred by the secondary and tertiary structure of tRNA |CITS: [15037613]|.
/The ThiI protein, but not the IscS protein, was shown to interact with tRNA.  <i>In vitro</i> studies using radiolabelled sulfur showed transfer of sulfur from IscS to ThiI; if tRNA is included, the sulfur appears to be incorporated into the tRNA in a ThiI- and ATP-dependent manner.  Based on these results, a model for mobilization and transfer of sulfur from cysteine via IscS and ThiI to U8 of tRNA has been presented |CITS: [10753862]|.

The free carboxylate group of the terminal glycine is activated by an accessory protein (MoeB in bacteria, MOCS3 in humans and Cnx5 in plants) to a carboxy-adenylate form, which is then sulfurylated by a sulfurase (|FRAME: CPLX0-248 IscS| in bacteria, the rhodanese-like domain of molybdopterin synthase sulfurylase in eukaryotes), resulting in a thiocarboxylate. Each small subunit in the complex donates the sulfur atom of the thiocarboxylate to |FRAME: PRECURSOR-Z|, resulting in formation of |FRAME: CPD-4| |CITS: [11459846]|.

TYPES - Opsins
COMMON-NAME - a metarhodopsin II
COMMENT - Photon absorption by |FRAME: CPD-881| bound to |FRAME:Rhodopsins| converts it to the <i>all-trans</i> form, which is a strong agonist for opsin. The photoisomerization of the retinoid induces a series of rapid conformational changes of the pigment molecule that convert it to the physiologically active state (|FRAME: Metarhodopsins-II "Meta II"|) within ~1 milisecond. Meta II is the form of rhodopsin that activates the visual G-protein, transducin, triggering a second messenger cascade. 
/
/Following activation of transducin, |FRAME: Metarhodopsins-II "metarhodopsin II"| is deactivated in a process that involves phosphorylation and arrestin binding. Vertebrate rhodopsin eventually dissociates into |FRAME: RETINAL| and opsin |CITS: [3006038][2719933][2550422]|, and needs to be regenerated in a reverse process that involves arrestin release, dephosphorylation, and the binding of a newly synthesized molecule of |FRAME: CPD-881| |CITS: [13011282][1386362]|. Invertebrate metarhodopsin, on the other hand, is thermally stable, and rhodopsin regeneration is triggered by the absorption of a second photon |CITS: [3780740][8446607][8639666]|.
/
/The retinal chromophore is connected to the protein via a Schiff base (a double bond between a carbon in the chromophore to a nitrogen in a lysine residue of opsin). The structure shown here is a generic representation, as not all rhodopsins utilize this particular form of retinal.

UNIQUE-ID - Rhodopsins
TYPES - Opsins
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a rhodopsin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Rhodopsins Rhodopsin| is a biological pigment found in the retina that is responsible for both the formation of the photoreceptor cells and the first events in the perception of light. 
/
/Vertebrate rhodopsin consists of the protein moiety |FRAME: Opsins opsin| (|FRAME: Aporhodopsins <i>apo</i>-rhodopsin|), which is a G protein-coupled receptor, and a reversibly covalently bound cofactor, |FRAME: CPD-881| |CITS: [6342691]|. Insect rhodopsin often contains |FRAME: 3-Hydroxy-11-cis-retinal| |CITS: [Seki98]|. Most insects examined use the |FRAME: CPD-14329 "R enantiomer"| of 3-hydroxyretinal, but the dipteran suborder |FRAME: TAX-480117|, including |FRAME: TAX-7215|, use |FRAME: CPD-14328|. Firefly squid (|FRAME: TAX-6625|) have been found to use |FRAME: CPD-14331| |CITS: [3416013]|. 
/
/When a photon is absorbed by the retinal chromophore, it isomerizes from |FRAME: CPD-881| into |FRAME: RETINAL| (while bound to the protein) and induces a conformational change in the opsin. In mammalian cells this process is known as bleaching. The protein goes through several conformations: 
/
/photorhodopsin &rarr; bathorhodopsin &rarr; lumirhodopsin &rarr; metarhodopsin I &rarr; metarhodopsin II
/
/|FRAME: Metarhodopsins-II "Metarhodopsin II"| activates the associated G protein transducin and triggers a second messenger cascade. It is subsequently deactivated in a process that involves phosphorylation and binding of the protein arrestin. Vertebrate rhodopsin eventually dissociates into |FRAME: RETINAL| and |FRAME: Aporhodopsins opsin| |CITS: [3006038][2719933][2550422]|, and needs to be regenerated in a reverse process that involves arrestin release, dephosphorylation, and the binding of a newly synthesized molecule of |FRAME: CPD-881| |CITS: [13011282][1386362]|. Invertebrate metarhodopsin, on the other hand, is thermally stable, and rhodopsin regeneration is triggered by the absorption of a second photon |CITS: [3780740][8446607][8639666]|.

/Despite its relatively large size it contains only one heme. Its amino acid suggests that it is completely different, except for its haem-binding site, from all other cytochromes |CITS: [2851998]|.

//
UNIQUE-ID - 2Fe-2S-proteins
TYPES - FeS-Proteins
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an [2Fe-2S] cluster protein
COMMENT - |FRAME: FeS-Proteins "Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins"| contain iron atom(s) ligated by inorganic sulfide and/or at least two cysteinyl (Cys) ligands. The main function of the Fe-S active sites is electron transfer, mostly in the range of low oxidation-reduction potentials. 
/In addition to their roles in electron transfer reactions, iron-sulfur proteins are also known to participate in the activation of substrates, the stabilization of radicals and structures, the protection of proteins from enzymes and the storage of iron and sulfur. In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate in regulation of gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|. Fe-S active sites are perhaps the most ancient cofactors.
/
/The simplest Fe-S proteins contain a mononuclear thiolate complex [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>, as it occurs in |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. However, in the great majority of Fe-S proteins the iron is present in clusters, with the iron linked by sulfides.
/
/Several cluster types have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-6|, |FRAME: CPD-23|, |FRAME: 3FE-4S| and |FRAME: CPD-7|. The [3Fe-4S] cluster is relatively rare, and 3Fe/4Fe interconversion may occur with minimal protein reorganization. In another type of Fe-S cluster, known as |FRAME: CPD0-1098|, two of the 4 cysteine residues are substituted by histidine residues. Although the clusters contain several iron atoms, each one usually transfers only one electron, so, for example, a protein with two [4Fe-4S] clusters will usually transfer two electrons.
/
/As mentioned above, small electron transfer proteins that contain only mononuclear [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> complexes are called |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. Small electron transfer proteins that contain only [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters are called |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|. When Fe-S clusters occur in larger (and sometimes membrane-bound) proteins together with other prosthetic groups and/or metal cofactors, the proteins are designated as complex Fe-S proteins. 
/
/Many complex Fe-S proteins contain multiple clusters arranged in chains, separated 1 - 1.4 nm apart, which allow electron transfer across considerable distances. Other electron-transferring groups such as heme or flavin may also be present. Examples include the electron transport chains of mitochondrial respiration (|FRAME: EC-1.6.5.3 "complex I"|, |FRAME: EC-1.3.5.1 "complex II"| and |FRAME: EC-1.10.2.2 "complex III"|) and photosynthesis (|FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12 "photosystem I"|), and enzymes such as |FRAME: EC-1.12.1.2 hydrogenase|, |FRAME: EC-1.18.6.1 nitrogenase| and |FRAME: EC-1.17.1.4 "xanthine dehydrogenase"|.
/
/Some enzymes with |FRAME: CPD-7 "4Fe-4S clusters"| are able to achieve unusual reducing power utilizing hydrolysis of MgATP. In these proteins the [4Fe-4S] cluster is located between two subunits of a protein, each contributing two Cys ligands, and each binding one molecule of ATP which is hydrolyzed during electron transfer. These proteins achieve reductions requiring potential differences of more than 1 V.
/
/It should be noted that in enzymes that utilize Fe-S clusters not for electron transfer but directly in catalysis, such as |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.3 aconitase| and radical SAM enzymes, one of iron atoms is free (rather than ligated to an amino acid) and can bind the substrate directly.

UNIQUE-ID - Oxidized-ferredoxins
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
TYPES - Ferredoxins
COMMON-NAME - an oxidized ferredoxin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Ferredoxins Ferredoxins| are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes. 
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to
/as |FRAME: FeS-Centers|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential.
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into three groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. 
/The first group consists of monomeric proteins containing one [2Fe-2S] cluster, which includes ferredoxins
/that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms
/(from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers
/in photosynthesis. 
/
/The other two groups consist of ubiquitous proteins containing [3Fe-4S]/ [4Fe-4S] and are typically found in bacteria.
/They may differ in cluster type (3Fe or 4Fe), number (one or two), and length of polypeptide chain
/(up to over 100 residues), and include the relatively small 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins that were first isolated from
/anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [16466637]|.
/
/Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.
/
/The structure given for this entry is that of a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin, and is provided for illustration only.

UNIQUE-ID - Ox-Glutaredoxins
TYPES - Glutaredoxins
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an oxidized glutaredoxin
COMMENT - Glutaredoxins are small redox proteins of the TRX superfamily using glutathione (GSH) as electron donor.
/Like thioredoxins they reduce intracellular disulfides, but they are much more efficient than thioredoxins in
/catalyzing protein deglutathionylation by reduction of protein-GSH mixed disulfides |CITS:[12682041]|.
/The glutaredoxins seem to play a major role in oxidative stress responses and iron-sulfur cluster
/assembly .
/
/Glutaredoxins have been divided into three classes - the "classical" dithiol proteins, monothiol proteins,
/and GST-related dithiol proteins.
/The classical dithiol glutaredoxins contain two cysteine residues, usually in a CPYC active-site motif;
/while the monothiol glutaredoxins contain a single cysteine found in a CGFS motif in the active site.
/The third group includes atypical glutaredoxins, which are very similar to glutathione-S-transferase (GST)
/proteins, but incorporate the CPYC motif |CITS: [11898418]|. More recently a fourth group of glutaredoxins
/has been described in higher plants. Proteins in this group include a CCXC or CCXS active-site motif
/|CITS: [17089213]|.
/
/Glutaredoxins can use a dithiol mechanism similar to that employed by thioredoxins. However,
/unlike thioredoxins glutaredoxins can utilize the thiols from GSH in solution together with the glutaredoxin
/N-terminal cysteine in a mechanism that is called the monothiol mechanism.

COMMENT - Thioredoxin is a small electron-transfer protein that contains a cysteine disulfide/dithiol active site in the form of C-X-X-C.  It functions in a wide variety of cellular processes. 
/
/Thioredoxin is reduced by NADPH in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: THIOREDOXIN-REDUCT-NADPH-CPLX|. The conversion between the oxidized and reduced forms results in a change of conformation and a significant change in functional properties. The reduced thioredoxin is a powerful protein disulfide reductase that catalyzes dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions with many substrates.
/
/The oxidized form of thioredoxin has been crystallized, the reduced form has been solved by NMR |CITS: [6378624][3896121][3152490][2187529] [2193685] [8098620] [2181145]|.

COMMENT - Flavodoxin (Fld) is a soluble electron shuttle flavoprotein (it binds a flavin mononucleotide) that is isofunctional with ferredoxin (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal electron acceptors of |FRAME: CPLX490-3509|.
/
/Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity. Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
/reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR). The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by |FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.
/
/Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. Fld can substitute Fd under conditions of iron deprivation in most cyanobacteria and some algae and may be efficient in reducing most or all of these soluble enzymes |CITS: [11687213]|.

COMMON-NAME - a [citrate-lyase] (citryl form)
COMMENT - Citrate lyase, an anaerobic enzyme, catalyzes the cleavage of citrate to acetate and oxaloacetate
/|CITS: [6354265]|. The citrate molecule is very stable, and needs to be activated prior to cleavage by
/forming a thioester bond with the enzyme.
/
/The enzyme is a complex of three subunits (in a 6:6:6 configuration), one of them a dedicated acyl carrier protein (acp).
/It is synthesized in an apo form, and is converted to its holo form by the covalent binding of the unusual prosthetic group |FRAME: 2-5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-3-DEPHOSPHO-COA| to the [acp] component, resulting in |FRAME: DEACETYL-CITRATE-LYASE|. However, this holo form is still not fully active - in order to be active, the prosthetic group needs to be acetylated, a reaction catalyzed by the |FRAME: G6344|-encoded |FRAME: CITC-MONOMER|, which generates |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|.
/
/The &alpha; subunit of the |FRAME: ACECITLY-CPLX| is a citrate-[acp] transferase that catalyzes the exchange of the bound acetyl group with a citrate molecule, generating |FRAME: Citrate-Lyase-Citryl-Forms| and releasing an |FRAME: ACET| molecule.
/The &beta; subunit, which is a citryl-[acp] lyase, catalyzes the subsequent step, cleaving the bound citryl group, releasing |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and regenerating |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|. Since the active form is regenrated, the enzyme can continuously catalyze the cleavage reaction.

UNIQUE-ID - Composite-Reactions
TYPES - Chemical-Reactions
COMMENT - A composite reaction R is represented both as a net chemical
/transformation, and a set of sub-reactions of which R is comprised.
/Those sub-reactions represent finer grained details of the reaction.
/Thus, composite reactions may have their mechanistic details recorded,
/when such information is available.  The relationships among the
/sub-reactions are stored in the same way as are the relationships of
/reactions within a pathway (i.e. using the Reaction-List/In-Pathway and 
/Predecessors slots).  As a result, composite reactions exhibit
/hybrid properties: internally, they are constructed like pathways, and
/externally, they look like reactions.
/
/The LEFT and RIGHT slots of composite reactions reflect the overall
/inputs and outputs of the composite transformation.  At a later point
/in time, these slots should be automatically kept in synch with the
/sub-reactions.  However, currently the Reaction Editor will have the
/burden of updating the LEFT and RIGHT slots.
/
/An enzyme that is linked to a composite reaction may or may not also
/be linked to its sub-reactions -- cases when we might not want to link
/the enzyme to sub-reactions might be if one or more sub-reactions are
/spontaneous (so the enzyme would only be linked to the non-spontaneous
/sub-reactions), or if the enzyme were a complex with each of its subunits
/catalyzing a different sub-reaction (in which case it should be the subunit
/that is linked to each corresponding sub-reaction, not the complex).

COMMENT - Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are isoprenoid quinones of the naphthalene series, and are constituents of bacterial plasma membranes, where they play important roles in electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation.
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are named MK-<i>n</i> or DMK-<i>n</i>, respectively, where the <i>n</i> refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain.  The most common length of the side chain in bacteria is 8, although minor amounts of MK-1 through MK-14 have been found |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation. These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lengths there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).

UNIQUE-ID - Lignins

COMMON-NAME - a lignin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Lignins Lignin| is a complex phenolic biopolymer and an integral part of the secondary cell walls of plants and some algae. It is one of the most abundant organic polymers on Earth, exceeded only by |FRAME: CELLULOSE|, and constitutes from a quarter to a third of the dry mass of wood.
/
/During the formation of the secondary cell wall, lignin fills the spaces in the cell wall between the |FRAME: CELLULOSE|, |FRAME: Hemicelluloses|, and |FRAME: Pectin pectin| components, driving out water and strengthening the wall.
/
/Lignin is heterogeneous, and lacks a defined primary structure. The main basic monomers (known as monolignols) are the phenylpropanoids |FRAME: COUMARYL-ALCOHOL|, |FRAME: CONIFERYL-ALCOHOL|, and |FRAME: SINAPYL-ALCOHOL| (see |FRAME: PWY-361|). The composition and relative abundance of the lignols differ among different organisms. The monolignols are glycosylated for the purpose of transport to the lignification zone, but the glucose moiety is removed prior to polymerization (see |FRAME: PWY-83|).
/The biosynthesis of lignin is not well understood. It consists of radical-radical coupling, and is catalyzed by oxidative enzymes (peroxidases and/or laccases). Lignin is covalently linked to the hemicellulose fibers, and thus crosslinks different components of the cell wall, conferring mechanical strengtth.
/
/Lignin can be degraded by certain fungi and bacteria that produce the enzymes |FRAME: MANGANESE-PEROXIDASE-RXN "manganese peroxidase"|, |FRAME: DIARYLPROPANE-PEROXIDASE-RXN "lignin peroxidase"| and |FRAME: CELLOBIOSE-DEHYDROGENASE-ACCEPTOR-RXN "cellobiose dehydrogenase"|.

COMMON-NAME - cofactor F<sub>420</sub>
COMMENT - One of the distinguishing features of methanogenic bacteria is their blue-green fluorescence when irradiated with UV light. This fluorescence is due to F420, a cofactor that was identified on the basis of this feature.
/This compound, named for its intense absorbance at 420 nm, was originally isolated by Cheeseman et al |CITS: [5079072]|, and later identified by Eirich et al as the N-(N-L-lactyl-&gamma;-L-glutamyl)-L-glutamic acid phosphodiester of 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin 5'-phosphate |CITS: [728375]|.
/
/The F420 biosynthetic pathway produces the intermediate F420-0, which contains no glutamate side chains.
/Glutamates are then added by several enzymes. F420 molecules isolated from different organisms differ in the number of the glutamate molecules in the side chains, as well as the nature of the bond (which could be either &alpha; or &gamma;) |CITS: [12909715][12867481][11717263]|.

UNIQUE-ID - FeS-Centers
TYPES - Coenzymes
COMMON-NAME - an iron-sulfur cluster
COMMENT - Iron-sulfur clusters are cofators of |FRAME: FeS-Proteins "iron-sulfur proteins"| and consist of a cluster of two to four iron atoms linked to sulfides, some of which are cysteine residues of the protein.
/
/Several cluster types have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-6|, |FRAME: CPD-23|, |FRAME: 3FE-4S| and |FRAME: CPD-7|. The [3Fe-4S] cluster is relatively rare, and 3Fe/4Fe interconversion may occur with minimal protein reorganization. In another type of Fe-S cluster, known as |FRAME: CPD0-1098|, two of the 4 cysteine residues that are coordinated with the iron atoms in regular |FRAME: CPD-6| are substituted by histidine residues. Although the clusters contain several iron atoms, each one usually transfers only one electron, so, for example, a protein with two [4Fe-4S] clusters will usually transfer two electrons.
/
/Small electron transfer proteins that contain only [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters are called |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|. When Fe-S clusters occur in larger (and sometimes membrane-bound) proteins together with other prosthetic groups and/or metal cofactors, the proteins are designated as complex Fe-S proteins. 
/
/In addition to their roles in electron transfer reactions, iron-sulfur clusters are also known to participate in
/the activation of substrates, the stabilization of radicals and structures, the protection of proteins from enzymes
/and the storage of iron and sulfur. In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate in gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|.

COMMENT - Maltodextrins are linear polymers of glucose molecules joined by an <i>O</i>-glycosidic
/(&alpha;-1->4) bond. Maltodextrins are formed from the partial hydrolysis of starch and glycogen.  It is a mixture of glucose,
/maltose (two glucose units), oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides. In this generic compound structure, the R1 group can represent an (&alpha;-1->4)-linked glucan chain containing one or more glucosyl residues, or it can represent a hydroxyl group.
/
/This poly-6-phosphogluco-maltodextrin has more than one &alpha;-linked glucosyl residue that is phosphorylated at the C6 position |CITS: [19325165]|. In this image, the phophorylation can be at R2 or R3 or R4 and must occur on at least two C6 residues throughout the whole glucan-chain. In other words, if either R2, R3, or R4 has a single C6-phosphorylated glucosyl residues, an additional C6-phosphorylated glucosyl residue could occur further away in the molecule in the "R1" portion of the polyglucan chain. 
/
/In the [Gln]<sub>(n)</sub>[Glc6-P]<sub>(m)</sub> notation, n is equal to the number of glucosyl residues in the &alpha;-glucan chain and m refers to the number of glucosyl residues with a C6-phosphorylated residue with m greater than 1.

/Although ginsenosides only have three kinds of aglycones, more than 60 kinds of ginsenosides have been identified by now due to the variability in the type of sugar moieties, their number, and the carbon positions they link to.
/
/The biological activity of ginsenoside increases with the decrease of the number of the sugar moieties.

UNIQUE-ID - Sphingomyelins
TYPES - SPHINGOLIPIDS
COMMON-NAME - a sphingomyelin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Sphingomyelins Sphingomyelins| are a type of |FRAME: SPHINGOLIPIDS sphingolipids| found in animal cell membranes, especially in the membranous myelin sheath that surrounds some nerve cell axons. It usually consists of |FRAME: PHOSPHORYL-CHOLINE| and |FRAME: Ceramides|. 
/
/Sphingomyelins are found in all tissues and lipoproteins; for example, they account for ~5% of the lipid phosphate in liver and 25% in pancreas |CITS: [2187537]|. Sphingomyelins have a function in signal transduction |CITS: [8086039]|.  
/
/Sphingomyelins are highly enriched in the plasma membrane of cells, and were considered to be found largely in the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane. However, there is some evidence that there may also be a sphingomyelin pool in the inner leaflet of the membrane |CITS: [2187537]|. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2, an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelins into ceramides, has been found to localize exclusively to the inner leaflet, further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there.
/
/Sphingomyelin can accumulate in a rare hereditary disease called <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=257200">Niemann-Pick Disease</A>. The disease is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme sphingomyelinase, rsulting in accumulation of sphingomyelin in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and the brain, causing irreversible neurological damage.

UNIQUE-ID - Estrogens
TYPES - Steroid-Hormones
COMMON-NAME - an estrogen
COMMENT - Estrogens are steroid hormones that stimulate or control the development and maintenance of female sex characteristics in mammals by binding to estrogen receptors. They are important in both the menstrual and the estrous reproductive cycles.
/
/Estrogens are synthesized in all vertebrates as well as some insects, suggesting that estrogenic sex hormones have an ancient evolutionary history.
/
/The main |FRAME: Estrogens estrogens| in humans are |FRAME: ESTRONE|, |FRAME: CPD-352| and |FRAME: ESTRIOL|, which differ in the number of hydroxyl groups (one for |FRAME: ESTRONE|, two for |FRAME: CPD-352| and three for |FRAME: ESTRIOL|). |FRAME: CPD-352| is about 10 times as potent as |FRAME: ESTRONE| and about 80 times as potent as |FRAME: ESTRIOL| in its estrogenic effect.
/
/|FRAME: CPD-352| is the predominant estrogen in non-pregenant women during their reproductive years in terms of serum levels. |FRAME: ESTRONE Estrone| is the predominant circulating estrogen in women during menopause and |FRAME: ESTRIOL| is the predominant circulating estrogen during pregnancy.

UNIQUE-ID - Cytokinins
TYPES - Plant-Hormones
COMMON-NAME - a cytokinin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Cytokinins Cytokinins| are a class of plant hormones that promote cell division, or cytokinesis, in plant roots and shoots. While their main role is to control cell growth and differentiation, they also affect apical dominance, axillary bud growth, and leaf senescence.
/
/The cytokinins are structurally diverse, and have been divided into two main types: |FRAME: Adenine-Cytokinins "adenine-type cytokinins"| and |FRAME: Phenylurea-Cytokinins "phenylurea-type cytokinins"|. All the natural cytokinins fall into the first type - phenylurea-type cytokinins are synthetic.
/
/The adenine cytokinins are classified further by the configuration of their N6-side chain as isoprenoid or aromatic cytokinins. The most prevalent cytokinins are by far those with an unsaturated isoprenoid side chain, and in particular those with a <i>trans</i>-hydroxylated N6-side chain, such as |FRAME: CPD-4210| and its derivatives.

/(see |FRAME: Jasmonic-Acids|) that can exist as 4 different stereoisomers.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Strigolactones
TYPES - Plant-Hormones
COMMON-NAME - a strigolactone
COMMENT - Strigolactones are plant hormones that stimulate the branching and growth of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, but inhibit plant shoot branching. They promote the probability of establishment of a symbiotic association between the plant and the fungi.
/
/The first strigolactone (|FRAME: CPD-14655|) was described from |FRAME: TAX-3635| (cotton) infected by the root parasitic weeds |FRAME: TAX-4169| (witchweed) (hence the name). It has been shown that the seeds of the parasites germinated only if they were exposed to stimulant molecules present in the root exudate of the host. Although the nature of strigol was not understood at the time, it was observed that it was active at hormonal levels |CITS: [17780042]|.
/
/Discovery of additional strigolactones from other plants followed, such as |FRAME: CPD-14659| from |FRAME: TAX-4558| |CITS: [Hauck92]|, |FRAME: CPD-14660| from |FRAME: TAX-3917| |CITS: [Mueler92]| and |FRAME: CPD-14657| from |FRAME: TAX-57577| (red clover) |CITS: [Yokota98]|.
/
/The real purpose of strigolactones, which was understood 40 years after the discovery of strigol, is to promote the formation of symbiotic associations known as arbuscular mycorrhiza, which consist of close interaction between the plants roots and |FRAME: TAX-214504| fungi |CITS: [15944706][16574693]|. Arbuscular mycorrhiza, which are found in more than 80% of higher plant species, are one of the most ancient symbioses of land plants. The fungi acquire and deliver nutrients to the plants, which in return provides the fungi with carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis |CITS: [15944687]|.
/
/The lactones induce extensive hyphal branching in germinating spores of the fungi, which increases the chance of contact with the root and subsequently infecting it. The branching phenomenon has been known for more than 30 years before the identity of the chemical signal that promotes it has been traced to strigolactone |CITS: [Mosse73]|.
/
/Since strigolactones are very labile and active at concentrations as low as picomolar, they are active only in close proximity to potential host roots, ensuring successful interactionbetween the fungi the roots.
/
/Study of mutants lacking strigolactones suggest that the hormones are also involved in the regulation of shoot branching, acting as branch-inhibiting hormones |CITS: [15268852][15342640]|.

COMMENT - Citrate lyase, an anaerobic enzyme, catalyzes the cleavage of citrate to acetate and oxaloacetate
/|CITS: [6354265]|. The citrate molecule is very stable, and needs to be activated prior to cleavage by
/forming a thioester bond with the enzyme.
/
/The enzyme is a complex of three subunits (in a 6:6:6 configuration), one of them a dedicated acyl carrier protein (acp).
/It is synthesized in an apo form, and is converted to its holo form by the covalent binding of the unusual prosthetic group |FRAME: 2-5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-3-DEPHOSPHO-COA| to the [acp] component, resulting in |FRAME: DEACETYL-CITRATE-LYASE|. However, this holo form is still not fully active - in order to be active, the prosthetic group needs to be acetylated, a reaction catalyzed by the |FRAME: G6344|-encoded |FRAME: CITC-MONOMER|, which generates |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|.
/
/The &alpha; subunit of the |FRAME: ACECITLY-CPLX| is a citrate-[acp] transferase that catalyzes the exchange of the bound acetyl group with a citrate molecule, generating |FRAME: Citrate-Lyase-Citryl-Forms| and releasing an |FRAME: ACET| molecule.
/The &beta; subunit, which is a citryl-[acp] lyase, catalyzes the subsequent step, cleaving the bound citryl group, releasing |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and regenerating |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|. Since the active form is regenrated, the enzyme can continuously catalyze the cleavage reaction.

UNIQUE-ID - NiFe-hydrogenases
TYPES - Hydrogenases
COMMON-NAME - a [NiFe] hydrogenase
COMMENT - This class of proteins represents any [NiFe] hydrogenase that has been activated.
/
/<b>General Background </b>
/
/Hydrogenases catalyze the reversible interconversion of protons, electrons and  |FRAME:HYDROGEN-MOLECULE|, resulting in |FRAME:HYDROGEN-MOLECULE| oxidation to two protons or in the reverse direction, molecular hydrogen production by the reduction of protons.
/
/Most hydrogenases are metalloenzymes that contain iron-sulfur clusters. They have been subdivided into two main classes based on the composition of two metal atoms at their active center: [NiFe] hydrogenases and [FeFe] hydrogenases. These two classes are phylogenetically distinct. It should be noted that in some of the [NiFe] hydrogenases one of the Ni-bound cysteine residues is replaced by selenocysteine. Those enzymes are known as [NiFeSe] hydrogenases. The [FeFe] hydrogenases usually have high catalytic activity, but are sensitive to irreversible inactivation by |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE|, more so than [NiFe] hydrogenases. 
/
/While [FeFe] hydrogenases are limited to certain bacteria and a few unicellular eukaryotes, [NiFe] hydrogenases are widespread in both bacteria and archaea |CITS: [20463892]|. 
/
/ [NiFe] hydrogenases are usually heterodimeric proteins, but can be associated with additional subunits.The large subunit contains the [NiFe] catalytic site, while the smaller subunit contains 3 FeS clusters.  These clusters transfer electrons from an external electron donor to the [NiFe] site for reduction of protons |CITS: [20463892]|.
/Many [FeFe]-hydrogenases are monomeric but possess additional domains that contain FeS clusters |CITS: [18500479]|. The catalytic core of [FeFe] hydrogenases is a single domain of about 350 residues that accommodates the active site known as the H cluster.
/
/In addition, a third class of hydrogenases is found in some methanogenic archaea. These enzymes contain only a mononuclear Fe active site and no FeS clusters, and are known as [Fe] hydrogenases.

UNIQUE-ID - Reduced-Putidaredoxins
TYPES - Putidaredoxins
COMMON-NAME - a reduced putidaredoxin
COMMENT - Putidaredoxin (Pdx) is a 106-residue (11.6  kDa) ferredoxin that is produced in |FRAME: TAX-303| strains. It contains a |FRAME: CPD-6| and carries electrons from the flavoprotein putidaredoxin reductase (PdR) to the acceptor cytochrome CYP101, also known as P450cam because it catalyzes camphor hydroxylation. This NADH-supplied electron-transfer chain is one of the best studied of the P450 systems |CITS: [4383050]|. The structure of Pdx was determined by NMR methods |CITS: [8204575]|. The electronic properties and redox interactions of Pdx have been extensively studied |CITS: [1445875][8845752][8663375][9268300][10433692]|.
/Pdx carries one electron at a time, such that the two irons switch between [Fe3+, Fe3+] (oxidized) and [Fe2+, Fe3+] (reduced) states |CITS: [15103126]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Aporhodopsins
TYPES - Opsins
COMMON-NAME - an <i>apo</i>-rhodopsin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Rhodopsins Rhodopsin| is a biological pigment found in the retina that is responsible for both the formation of the photoreceptor cells and the first events in the perception of light. 
/
/Vertebrate rhodopsin consists of the protein moiety |FRAME: Opsins opsin| (|FRAME: Aporhodopsins <i>apo</i>-rhodopsin|), which is a G protein-coupled receptor, and a reversibly covalently bound cofactor, |FRAME: CPD-881| |CITS: [6342691]|. Insect rhodopsin often contains |FRAME: 3-Hydroxy-11-cis-retinal| |CITS: [Seki98]|. Most insects examined use the |FRAME: CPD-14329 "R enantiomer"| of 3-hydroxyretinal, but the dipteran suborder |FRAME: TAX-480117|, including |FRAME: TAX-7215|, use |FRAME: CPD-14328|. Firefly squid (|FRAME: TAX-6625|) have been found to use |FRAME: CPD-14331| |CITS: [3416013][8639666]|.
/
/
/Isomerization of |FRAME: CPD-881| into |FRAME: RETINAL| by light (while bound to the protein) induces a conformational change in opsin, known as bleaching. The protein goes through several conformations:  
/
/photorhodopsin &rarr; bathorhodopsin &rarr; lumirhodopsin &rarr; metarhodopsin I &rarr; metarhodopsin II
/
/|FRAME: Metarhodopsins-II "Metarhodopsin II"| activates the associated G protein transducin and triggers a second messenger cascade. It is subsequently deactivated in a process that involves phosphorylation and arrestin binding. Vertebrate rhodopsin eventually dissociates into |FRAME: RETINAL| and opsin |CITS: [3006038][2719933][2550422]|, and needs to be regenerated in a reverse process that involves arrestin release, dephosphorylation, and the binding of a newly synthesized molecule of |FRAME: CPD-881| |CITS: [13011282][1386362]|. Invertebrate metarhodopsin, on the other hand, is thermally stable, and rhodopsin regeneration is triggered by the absorption of a second photon |CITS: [3780740][8446607]|.

TYPES - All-ACPs
COMMON-NAME - a polyketide synthase containing an [acp] domain
COMMENT - Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are found in soil and marine filamentous bacteria, as well as in fungi and higher plants, and are responsible for producing such therapeutically important natural products as erythromycin and lovastatin. Analogous to the fatty acid synthases, PKSs can be divided to two types: multifunctional polyproteins (type I) and discrete protein (type II).
/
/Type I PKSs are organized into modular complexes, each catalyzing individual chain elongation steps using an associated carrier protein. The minimal type I PKS module consists of 3 domains: a ketosynthase, a acyltransferase, and an ACP. The acyltransferase domain catalyzes the priming of the flanking ACP domain with the appropriate substrate.
/
/Type II PKS ACPs, on the other hand, possess catalytic self-acylation activity |CITS: [18059524]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Cytochromes-c
TYPES - Cytochromes
COMMON-NAME - a <i>c</i>-type cytochrome
COMMENT - Cytochromes c (cytC) are electron-transfer proteins that have one or more |FRAME: HEME_C| groups, which are bound to the protein by one or two thioether bonds involving sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues.
/Cytochromes c possess a wide range of properties and function in a large number of different redox processes. In general, the differences in cytochromes c among bacteria are much larger than those among animal species.
/Bacterial cytochromes c function in the electron transport chains of bacteria with many different types of energy
/metabolism, including phototrophs, methylotrophs, denitrifiers, sulfate reducers and the nitrogen-fixers. 
/
/The |FRAME: Cytochromes-c "<i>c</i>-type cytochromes"|  have been classified in four classes based on their sequence (reviewed in |CITS: [1646017]|):
/
/|FRAME: Class-I-Cytochromes-C "Class I"| includes the low-spin soluble cytC of mitochondria and bacteria, with the heme-attachment site towards the N-terminus, and the sixth ligand provided by a methionine residue about 40 residues further on towards the C-terminus. Memebers of this class were further subdivided into the five subclasses, IA to IE, which are named long cytochrome c2, mitochondrial cytochrome c, split-a-band cytochromes c, cytochrome c8 and cytochrome c5, respectively .
/
/|FRAME: Class-II-Cytochromes-C "Class II"| includes the high-spin cytochromes c' and various low-spin cytochromes (e.g., Rhodopseudomonas palustris cytochrome c-556). The heme-attachment site is close to the C-terminus and in the low-spin proteins the sixth ligand is a methionine residue close to the N-terminus.
/
/|FRAME: Class-III-Cytochromes-C "Class III"| comprises the low redox potential multiple heme cytochromes c3 and c7, with only around thirty residues of
/amino acid per heme group.
/
/|FRAME: Class-IV-Cytochromes-C "Class IV"| was created to hold the complex proteins that have other prosthetic groups as well as heme c, such as the flavocytochromes c and the cytochromes cd.

UNIQUE-ID - FeS-Proteins-Oxidized
TYPES - FeS-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an oxidized iron-sulfur protein
COMMENT - Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins contain iron atom(s) ligated by inorganic sulfide and/or at least two cysteinyl (Cys) ligands. The main function of the Fe-S active sites is electron transfer, mostly in the range of low oxidation-reduction potentials. 
/In addition to their roles in electron transfer reactions, iron-sulfur proteins are also known to participate in the activation of substrates, the stabilization of radicals and structures, the protection of proteins from enzymes and the storage of iron and sulfur. In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate in regulation of gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|. Fe-S active sites are perhaps the most ancient cofactors.
/
/The simplest Fe-S proteins contain a mononuclear thiolate complex [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>, as it occurs in |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. However, in the great majority of Fe-S proteins the iron is present in clusters, with the iron linked by sulfides.
/
/Several cluster types have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-6|, |FRAME: CPD-23|, |FRAME: 3FE-4S| and |FRAME: CPD-7|. The [3Fe-4S] cluster is relatively rare, and 3Fe/4Fe interconversion may occur with minimal protein reorganization. In another type of Fe-S cluster, known as |FRAME: CPD0-1098|, two of the 4 cysteine residues are substituted by histidine residues. Although the clusters contain several iron atoms, each one usually transfers only one electron, so, for example, a protein with two [4Fe-4S] clusters will usually transfer two electrons.
/
/As mentioned above, small electron transfer proteins that contain only mononuclear [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> complexes are called |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. Small electron transfer proteins that contain only [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters are called |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|. When Fe-S clusters occur in larger (and sometimes membrane-bound) proteins together with other prosthetic groups and/or metal cofactors, the proteins are designated as complex Fe-S proteins. 
/
/Many complex Fe-S proteins contain multiple clusters arranged in chains, separated 1 - 1.4 nm apart, which allow electron transfer across considerable distances. Other electron-transferring groups such as heme or flavin may also be present. Examples include the electron transport chains of mitochondrial respiration (|FRAME: EC-1.6.5.3 "complex I"|, |FRAME: EC-1.3.5.1 "complex II"| and |FRAME: EC-1.10.2.2 "complex III"|) and photosynthesis (|FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12 "photosystem I"|), and enzymes such as |FRAME: EC-1.12.1.2 hydrogenase|, |FRAME: EC-1.18.6.1 nitrogenase| and |FRAME: EC-1.17.1.4 "xanthine dehydrogenase"|.
/
/Some enzymes with |FRAME: CPD-7 "4Fe-4S clusters"| are able to achieve unusual reducing power utilizing hydrolysis of MgATP. In these proteins the [4Fe-4S] cluster is located between two subunits of a protein, each contributing two Cys ligands, and each binding one molecule of ATP which is hydrolyzed during electron transfer. These proteins achieve reductions requiring potential differences of more than 1 V.
/
/It should be noted that in enzymes that utilize Fe-S clusters not for electron transfer but directly in catalysis, such as |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.3 aconitase| and radical SAM enzymes, one of iron atoms is free (rather than ligated to an amino acid) and can bind the substrate directly.

UNIQUE-ID - Ferredoxins
TYPES - FeS-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a ferredoxin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Ferredoxins Ferredoxins| are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes.
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to as |FRAME: FeS-Centers "iron-sulfur clusters"|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential.
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. The |FRAME: 2Fe-2S-Ferredoxins| group consists of monomeric proteins containing a single |FRAME: CPD-6|. This group includes ferredoxins that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms (from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers in photosynthesis. A related group contains |FRAME: Rieske-Type-Ferredoxins|, where two of the cysteine groups are replaces by histidine residues.
/
/|FRAME: 4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| and |FRAME: 3Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[3Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| are typically found in bacteria. They may differ in cluster type (3Fe or 4Fe), number of clusters (one or two), and length of polypeptide chain (up to over 100 residues), and include the relatively small dual cluster |FRAME: 2-4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| that were first isolated from anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [16466637]|.
/
/Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.
/
/The structure given for this entry is that of a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin, and is provided for illustration only.

COMMENT - Glutaredoxins are small redox proteins of the TRX superfamily using glutathione (GSH) as electron donor.
/Like thioredoxins they reduce intracellular disulfides, but they are much more efficient than thioredoxins in
/catalyzing protein deglutathionylation by reduction of protein-GSH mixed disulfides |CITS:[12682041]|.
/The glutaredoxins seem to play a major role in oxidative stress responses and iron-sulfur cluster
/assembly .
/
/Glutaredoxins have been divided into three classes - the "classical" dithiol proteins, monothiol proteins,
/and GST-related dithiol proteins.
/The classical dithiol glutaredoxins contain two cysteine residues, usually in a CPYC active-site motif;
/while the monothiol glutaredoxins contain a single cysteine found in a CGFS motif in the active site.
/The third group includes atypical glutaredoxins, which are very similar to glutathione-S-transferase (GST)
/proteins, but incorporate the CPYC motif |CITS: [11898418]|. More recently a fourth group of glutaredoxins
/has been described in higher plants. Proteins in this group include a CCXC or CCXS active-site motif
/|CITS: [17089213]|.

/
/Glutaredoxins can use a dithiol mechanism similar to that employed by thioredoxins. However,

UNIQUE-ID - Red-Thioredoxin
TYPES - Thioredoxin
COMMON-NAME - a reduced thioredoxin
COMMENT - Thioredoxin is a small electron-transfer protein that contains a cysteine disulfide/dithiol active site in the form of C-X-X-C.  It functions in a wide variety of cellular processes. 
/
/Thioredoxin is reduced by NADPH in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: THIOREDOXIN-REDUCT-NADPH-CPLX|. The conversion between the oxidized and reduced forms results in a change of conformation and a significant change in functional properties. The reduced thioredoxin is a powerful protein disulfide reductase that catalyzes dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions with many substrates.
/
/The oxidized form of thioredoxin has been crystallized, the reduced form has been solved by NMR |CITS: [6378624][3896121][3152490][2187529] [2193685] [8098620] [2181145]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Thioredoxin-A
TYPES - Thioredoxin
COMMON-NAME - a thioredoxin 1
COMMENT - Several types of thioredoxins were identified in bacteria.
/
/Thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) was first identified <i>in vitro</i> as a protein disulfide reductase that acts on |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-DIP-REDUCTI-CPLX "ribonucleotide reductase"| in 1964 |CITS: [14245400]|. Further characterization of Trx1 <i>in vitro</i> has shown that it can reduce the disulfides that are formed during catalysis by a range of enzymes, including |FRAME: PAPSSULFOTRANS-CPLX| |CITS: [7016827]| and |FRAME: EG11433-MONOMER "methionine sulfoxide reductase"| (Msr) |CITS: [4392601]|. <i>In vivo</i> experiments with |FRAME: TAX-562| mutant strains have confirmed these observations |CITS: [11544348]|. In addition, thioredoxin 1 can also transfer electrons to  the membrane protein |FRAME: DSBD-MONOMER|, which in turn transfers them to the periplasmic protein disulfide isomerases/oxidoreductases encoded by |FRAME: EG11070| and |FRAME: G6333| |CITS: [12004064]|. 
/
/Trx1 is also required for the assembly of the filamentous |FRAME: TAX-562| phages f1, T7 and M13, though this function is not related to its redox properties |CITS: [3533930]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Thioredoxin-B
TYPES - Thioredoxin
COMMON-NAME - a thioredoxin 2
COMMENT - Several types of thioredoxins were identified in bacteria.
/Thioredoxin 2 (Trx2) was first identified in E. coli. It contains two distinct domains: a C-terminal domain with the conserved WCGPC active site signature and an additional N-terminal domain of 32 residues which includes two conserved CXXC motifs |CITS: [9388228]| responsible for the tight binding of a zinc atom |CITS: [12952960]|.
/
/<i>In vitro</i> studies showed that E. coli Trx2 is a functional Trx, as it is capable of reducing insulin and ribonucleotide reductase and is an electron donor for 3'-phosphoadenylylsulfate reductase |CITS: [9388228][10075658]|. <i>In vivo</i>, Trx2 can substitute for Trx1 function, but only when Trx2 is overexpressed.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Flavodoxin
TYPES - Flavoproteins
COMMON-NAME - a flavodoxin
COMMENT - Flavodoxin (Fld) is a soluble electron shuttle flavoprotein (it binds a flavin mononucleotide) that is 
/isofunctional with ferredoxin (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal
/electron acceptors of |FRAME: CPLX490-3509|.
/
/Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron
/flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows
/ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity.
/Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
/reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR).
/The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by
/|FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.
/
/Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism,
/sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. Fld can substitute Fd under conditions of
/iron deprivation in most cyanobacteria and some algae and may be efficient in reducing most or all of
/these soluble enzymes |CITS: [11687213]|.

COMMENT - Retinoid-binding proteins are carriers of various forms of vitamin A in body fluids and within the cell.
/The sequestration of retinoids inside a high-affinity binding-protein draws them into the cell and protects them from unfettered metabolism |CITS: [9932510][7683727]|.
/
/The |FRAME: IRBPs "interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein"| (IRBP) is a glycoprotein that shuttles 11-<i>cis</i> and <i>all-trans</i> retinoids between the pigment epithelium and the visual pigments in the photoreceptor cells of the retina. It is synthesized by rod photoreceptor cells and secreted into the interphotoreceptor matrix.
/
/Binding studies have shown that each mole of IRBP can bind 2 mol of |FRAME: CPD-13524 with an association constant of 1x10<sup>-6</sup> M. Small amounts of the 11-<i>cis</i> and 13-<i>cis</i> isomers were also found bound to purified protein. In addition to |FRAME: CPD-13524|, bovine IRBP binds retinal, retinoic acid, cholesterol, fatty acids, and tocopherol| |CITS: [6427217]|.
/
/Both the human cDNA and gene sequences have been obtained |CITS:[3455009][2792773][2303470]|. The large size of the protein (136 kDa) is probably the result of Internal quadruplication |CITS: [3170584]|.

/
/Vertebrate retinal-binding proteins are not present in the photoreceptor cells themselves, and are located in the adjacent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and in the Mueller glial cells of the retina |CITS: [3584132][7929238]|.
/
/In molluscs, which do not have RPE, the retinal-binding proteins are located inside the visual cells, and are used to shuttle chromophores between |FRAME: Rhodopsins rhodopsin| and |FRAME: Retinochromes retinochrome| |CITS:[3660660][2626821][8106428][8243675]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Cellular-Retinol-Binding-Proteins
TYPES - Retinoid-binding-proteins
COMMON-NAME - a cellular-retinol-binding protein
COMMENT - Plasma retinol-binding protein (RBPs) and cellular retinol-binding proteins (CRBPs) are specific carriers of the alcohol form of vitamin A (retinol) in body fluids and within the cell, respectively.
/The sequestration of retinol inside a high-affinity binding-protein draws retinol into the cell and protects it from unfettered metabolism, while still allowing the formation of retinyl esters |CITS: [9932510][7683727]|. LRAT, the enzyme that forms retinyl-esters, can access retinol when it is bound to CRBP1 |CITS: [3198596][3178828]|.
/
/The CRBPs are monomeric proteins of approximately 15.5 kDa belonging to a superfamily of small cytoplasmic proteins that specifically interact with hydrophobic ligands. Two such proteins (|FRAME: ENSG00000114115-MONOMER "CRBP I"| and |FRAME: ENSG00000114113-MONOMER "CRBP II"|) with distinct tissue distributions and retinoid-binding properties have been recognized in mammals. 
/
/The human CRBP I is expressed at high levels in many tissues, including ovary, adrenal and pituitary glands, and testis |CITS: [3751963 ]|, while CRBP II is confined essentially to the small intestine. In addition, the Kd of the retinol-CRBP I complex is as low as 0.1 nM |CITS: [7744071]|, whereas the binding of retinol to CRBP II is ~100-fold weaker |CITS: [1995621]|.

TYPES - Protein-DNA-Binding-Reactions
COMMENT - Reactions in which a transcription factor binds to a DNA binding-site.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Electron-Transfer-Reactions
TYPES - Composite-Reactions
COMMENT - Electron transfer reactions (ETRs) describe reactions that transfer
/electrons between substrates, which are thus involved in redox
/processes that oxidize and reduce some of the substrates.  ETRs
/usually take place at membranes, because a key purpose of ETRs is to
/use the electron energy to build up a proton gradient across the
/membrane, which can then be used for energy generation by the cell,
/using ATP synthesis driven by the proton gradient.  ETRs very often
/involve the pool of membrane-bound quinone substrates, which can
/shuttle electrons to or from an ETR.
/
/All ETRs are composite reactions, because they involve at least two
/redox half reactions.  These half reactions involve explicit
/electrons, which cannot occur freely. Thus, the half reactions have to
/be paired up, with the result that the electrons are used only
/internally to connect the half reactions, and are not visible
/as substrates of the ETR.
/
/Sometimes, a proton transport reaction can also be a sub-reaction of
/the ETR, to represent so-called vectoral proton movement.  In the
/vectoral case, protons are actively pumped across the membrane, using
/energy extracted from the redox processes.  The proton transport
/reaction is not directly connected to the redox half reactions in the
/pathway representation of the composite reaction.
/
/Because ETRs tend to occur at membranes, substrates that are not in
/the default compartment (the cytoplasm) need to have compartment
/information associated by means of value annotations.  The exception
/to this are the membrane-bound quinone substrates, which are always
/assumed to reside in the membrane itself.

UNIQUE-ID - ISOQUINOLINE-ALKALOIDS
TYPES - ALKALOIDS-SYN
COMMON-NAME - Isoquinoline and Benzylisoquinoline Alkaloids Biosynthesis
COMMENT - Isoquinoline alkaloids constitute the group of the most abundant alkaloids in the plant kingdom. Isoquinolines are derived biosynthetically from the amino acid tyrosine generating the fundamental intermediate 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine (dopamine) and carbonyl units of different origin. The carbonyl donor unit is an &alpha;-ketoacid for isoquinoline and an aldehyde, i.e. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde in the case of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. Some representatives of isoquinoline and benzylisoquinoline alkaloids such as berberine are widely distributed in the plant kingdom. Others are more restricted to certain plant families such as pellotine in the <i>Cactaceae</i>, cularine in the <i>Fumariacea</i> and morphine in the <i>Papaveraceae</i>.  Morphine is still the most used painkiller in medicine. Other isoquinoline flavonoids such as codeine or papaverine are also considered useful medicinal drugs. 
//

//
UNIQUE-ID - QUINOLINE-ALKALOIDS
TYPES - ALKALOIDS-SYN
COMMON-NAME - Quinoline Alkaloids Biosynthesis
COMMENT - The biosynthetic origin of quinoline alkaloids is the aromatic amine anthranilic (2-aminobenzoic) acid involved in the metabolism of the amino acid tryptophan. The skeleton of quinoline alkaloids constitutes a bicyclic system with a fused benzene and pyridine ring. The attachment of a furan ring to the pyridine nucleus generates furoquinolines (e.g. furacridone), an important subgroup of quinoline alkaloids. The plant family <i>Rutaceae</i> represents the major source of quinoline alkaloids, e.g. maculine. Quinoline alkaloide are known to possess pharmaceutical activites but only a few such as quinine are used in medicine because of their antimalarial properties.
//
UNIQUE-ID - TROPANE-ALKALOIDS
TYPES - ALKALOIDS-SYN
COMMON-NAME - Tropane Alkaloids Biosynthesis
COMMENT - Tropane alkaloids are derived biosynthetically from the amino acid ornithine. Some tropane alkaloids such as atropine and hyoscyamine also recruit parts of their structure (tropanic acid moiety) from phenylalanine. Tropane alkaloids such as tropine occur primarily in the plant families <i>Solanaceae</i> and cocaine in the family <i>Erythroxylaceae</i>. Many members of the tropane alkaloid group have been exploited for their useful medicinal properties but are also considered to be highly addictive.
//
UNIQUE-ID - INDOLE-ALKALOIDS
TYPES - ALKALOIDS-SYN
COMMON-NAME - Indole Alkaloids Biosynthesis
COMMENT - The majority of indole alkaloids are derived biosynthetically from the amino acid tryptophan and the monoterpenoid precursor secologanin. Condensation of these two classes produces a wide range of complex skeletons in this division. Indole alkaloids such as vindoline occur extensively in the plant families <i>Apocynacea</i>, borreline in the <i>Rubiacea</i> and strychnine in the <i>Loganiacea</i> but are also present in a smaller number and variety in other angiosperm families. Many indole alkaloids are useful drugs possessing clinical values such as the tranquillizer reserpine or the ergot alkaloids employed for their relaxing and migraine relieving properties.   
//
UNIQUE-ID - POLYKETIDE-ALKALOIDS
TYPES - ALKALOIDS-SYN
COMMON-NAME - Polyketide Alkaloids Biosynthesis
COMMENT - A smaller number of alkaloids that are derived from a polyketide pathway are combined under the subclass of polyketide alkaloids. Polyketide alkaloids, for instance pinidine are found in plant families such as the <i>Pinaceae</i> and &gamma;-coniceine in the <i>Apiacea</i> where alkaloids are known to be rather uncommon.
//
UNIQUE-ID - PYRROLIZIDINE-ALKALOIDS
TYPES - ALKALOIDS-SYN
COMMON-NAME - Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids Biosynthesis
COMMENT - The group of pyrolizidine contains some of the most poisonous plant alkaloids. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids are biosynthetically derived from the amino acid ornithine via the amines putrescine and homospermidine. The skeleton of pyrrolizidine is composed of fused two 5-membered rings connected through a nitrogen bridge which are often esterified with amino alcohols (necines). Pyrrolizidine alkaloids such as senecionine occur mostly in the <i>Compositae</i> family especially in the genus <i>Senecio</i>.
//
UNIQUE-ID - BETALAIN-ALKALOIDS
TYPES - ALKALOIDS-SYN
COMMON-NAME - Betalaine Alkaloids Biosynthesis
COMMENT - Betalain alkaloids are derived biosynthetically from the amino acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) via the intermediate betalamic acid representing the common chromphore of betalains. The water soluble betalain alkaloids split up into two major groups, the betacyanins and betaxanthins. Betacyanins, for instance amaranthin and betaxanthins such as indicaxanthin are often found in fruits, flowers and leaves of higher plants. Betalaines replace other biological important plant pigments such as anthocyanine in most of the plant families of the order <i>Centrospermae</i>.
//
UNIQUE-ID - PEPTIDE-ALKALOIDS
TYPES - ALKALOIDS-SYN
COMMON-NAME - Peptide Alkaloids Biosynthesis
COMMENT - Peptide alkaloids are derived biosynthetically from a varying number of peptide-bounded and subsequently cyclized amino acids. A discrete structural feature is the almost common occurrence of an aromatic styrylamide group formed from the amino acid phenylalanine. Peptide alkaloids such as zizyphine are mostly found in the plant family <i>Rhamnaceae</i> but are also present in a few other plant families and in fungi, for instance &alpha;-amanithin the toxic principle in the death cap mushroom (<i>Amanita phalloides</i>).
//
UNIQUE-ID - PYRROLIDINE-ALKALOIDS
TYPES - ALKALOIDS-SYN
COMMON-NAME - Pyrrolidine, Piperidine and Pyridine Alkaloids Biosynthesis
COMMENT - This subclass constitutes plant alkaloids which originate from solitary nitrogen containing 5-membered ring (pyrrolidines), 6-membered ring (piperidines) or aromatic 6-membered ring (pyridine) systems. They are biosynthetically derived from ornithine (pyrrolidine), lysine (piperidine) and nicotinic acid (via tryptophan) in the case of pyridine alkaloids. Pyrrolidine alkaloids such as stachyhydrine are widespread in plants with no obvious restriction to monocots or dicots. Piperidine alkaloids, for instance piperine are often found in plant families such as <i>Piperaceae</i> or coniine in the <i>Apiacea</i>. Pyridine alkaloids such as nicotine are again more widely distributed and often associated with other alkaloids of the pyrrolidine and piperidine type. Some members of this subclass are biological active, acting as inhibitors for sugar-hydrolyzing enzymes, others have been utilized because of their pharmaceutical potential in the treatment of the human disease AIDS.
//
UNIQUE-ID - QUINOLIZIDINE-ALKALOIDS
TYPES - ALKALOIDS-SYN
COMMON-NAME - Quinolizidine Alkaloids Biosynthesis
COMMENT - Quinolizidine alkaloids are derived biosynthetically from the amino acid lysine. The skeleton of quinolizidine is composed of fused two 6-membered rings connected through a nitrogen bridge. Quinolizidine alkaloids such as lupinin are mostly restricted to the plant family <i>Fabaceae</i> and are found especially in the genus <i>Lupinus</i> which is why they are often referred to as lupin alkaloids. The value of quinolizidine alkaloids for plants is connected to their anti-herbivory properties but a few also have also been used in medicine such as retamine (hypotensive activity).

COMMON-NAME - protein secretion by the type II secretion system
COMMENT - Note that this term represents an activity and not a cellular structure. Consider also annotating to the cellular component term 'type II protein secretion system complex ; GO:0015627'. This process refers specifically to secretion across the outer membrane. For components of the Sec and Tat pathways, consider annotating to 'protein transport by the Sec complex ; GO:0043952' and 'protein transport by the Tat complex ; GO:0043953'. Note that this term is used for annotation of proteins that compose the secretion complex but not the proteins being secreted.

COMMON-NAME - protein transport by the Sec complex
COMMENT - Note that this term represents an activity and not a cellular structure. Consider also annotating to the cellular structure term 'cell envelope Sec protein transport complex ; GO:0031522'. For proteins involved in bacterial Type II secretion across the outer membrane, consider annotating to 'protein secretion by the Type II secretion system ; GO:0015628'. For proteins involved in Sec-complex dependent translocation into the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum, consider annotating to 'SRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane, translocation ; GO:0006616'. Note that this term is used for annotation of proteins that compose the transport complex but not the proteins being transported.

UNIQUE-ID - Quinones
TYPES - Cyclic-Ketones
COMMON-NAME - a quinone
COMMENT - Quinones are organic compounds derived from aromatic compound, with two carbonyl groups incorporated into the ring structure with rearrangement of the double bonds where necessary. A classic example of a quinone is |FRAME: P-BENZOQUINONE|. Quinones are commonly named with a prefix that indicates the parent aromatic hydrocarbon (for example, "benzo-" for benzene, "naphtho-" for naphthalene, and "anthra-" for anthracene) with a "-quinone" suffix.
/
/Several types of quinones serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains. Quinones can carry two electrons, and when fully reduced they are referred to as |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinols|. The addition of a single H atom to a quinone results in formation of a free radical called |FRAME: Semiquinones|.
/
/Many quinone derivatives often have other biological activities, such as |FRAME: CPD-11501 "vitamin K"|.

UNIQUE-ID - Anthraquinones
TYPES - ETR-Quinones
COMMON-NAME - an anthraquinone
COMMENT - Anthraquinone derivatives are found in microorganisms, fungi, plants, marine organisms, and insects. In higher plants, most anthraquinones occur as mono- or diglycosides. The yellow or red colored compounds have some commercial relevance as natural dyes. 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinones serve as laxatives.
/
/In fungi and some higher plants (Leguminosae, Rhamnaceae, Polygonaceae, and Caesalpiniaceae), anthraquinones are biosynthesized via a polyketide pathway which comprises the successive condensation of acetyl CoA with 7 molecules of malonyl CoA to form an octa-&alpha;-keto-acyl chain, which is converted to the anthraquinone system via decarboxylation, cyclization, and aromatization.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Demethylmenaquinones
TYPES - ETR-Quinones
COMMON-NAME - a demethylmenaquinone
COMMENT - Menaquinols are the reduced form of |FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinones"|.
/
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are isoprenoid quinones of the naphthalene series, and are constituents of
/bacterial plasma membranes, where they play important roles in electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation.
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are named MK-<i>n</i> or DMK-<i>n</i>, respectively, where the <i>n</i> 
/refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain. 
/The most common length of the side chain in bacteria is 8, although minor amounts of MK-1 through
/MK-14 have been found |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation. These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lenghts there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).

UNIQUE-ID - PLASTOQUINONE
TYPES - ETR-Quinones
COMMON-NAME - a plastoquinone
COMMENT - |FRAME: PLASTOQUINONE Plastoquinones| (PQ) are benzoquinone electron carriers that can function as acceptor/donor for either one or two electrons. They are analogs of |FRAME: Ubiquinones "ubiquinones"| (Coenzyme Q), with two methyl groups substituting the methoxy groups found in Q. The fully reduced form is called |FRAME: PLASTOQUINOL-1|.
/
/Plastoquinones are found in the chloroplasts of higher plants, red, brown and green algae, and in cyanobacteria, and are important members of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain, where they carry electrons from |FRAME: CPLX490-3506| to the |FRAME: CPLX490-29|. Plastoquinones also serve as cofactors involved in the desaturation of phytoene in the synthesis of carotenoids (see |FRAME: PWY-6475|).
/
/Plastoquinone was isolated originally in 1946 from alfalfa, but was not identified at the time. It was rediscovered in 1959 and its structure was described in the same year (see |CITS: [7022156]|).
//
UNIQUE-ID - Ubiquinones
TYPES - ETR-Quinones
COMMON-NAME - an ubiquinone
COMMENT - The ubiquinones are a group of lipid-soluble benzoquinones involved in electron transport. Their structures
/have a variable length side chain, which consists of one to twelve mono-unsaturated
/<I>trans</I>-isoprenoids units, with ten units being the most common in animals.
/|FRAME: TAX-4932| has 6 units, |FRAME: TAX-71421| has 7, |FRAME: TAX-83333| has 8, |FRAME: TAX-1142|
/has 9, |FRAME: TAX-9606| has 10, and |FRAME: TAX-1270| has an 11 unit form |CITS: [16233343]|.
/
/The terms ubiquinone/ubiquinol refer to the oxidized/reduced forms, and are often used interchangeably.
/The forms are readily interconvertable. 
/
/Ubiquinone is also known as coenzyme Q, or just Q. The names are often followed by the number of the prenoid units in the side chain (e.g. Q-8), or the number of carbons in the chain. For example, the name Q-8 may be substituted with ubiiquinone(40). Since these carbons occur in repeating units of five, these number are multiples of 5.

/Even though fatty acids derived from natural fats and oils, such as |FRAME:CPD-195|, are usually at least 8 carbon atoms long, carboxylic acids as short as |FRAME:BUTYRIC_ACID| (4 carbon atoms) are considered to be fatty acids.
/
/Fatty acids are often classified into four groups by their lengths:
/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic chains of fewer than six carbons.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic chain of 6-12 carbons.
/
/|FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "Long-chain fatty acids"| (LCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic chains of 13-22 carbons.

/ 
/
/Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.

COMMON-NAME - an aureolic acid
COMMENT - Aureolic acids are glycoside compounds that have a 1-keto-8,9-dihydroxyanthracene skeleton, a functionalized alkyl chain at the 3- position, a disaccharide and a trisaccharide unit.
/
/All aureolic acid-group drugs (including |FRAME: CPD-13955|, chromomycin A3, olivomycin A, UCH9, and |FRAME: CPD-14364|) contain the same tricyclic core moiety, but differ mainly with regard to their saccharide moieties, which consist of various 2,6-dideoxysugar chains that are linked at the 2- and 6-positions of the aglycon moiety. The structural variations in the glycosidic moieties are responsible for subtle differences in the DNA binding and activity profiles amongst the group members |CITS: [15712316]|.
/
/Studies have shown that aureolic acids from a dimer with a Mg<sup>2+</sup> cation at the center of the dimer before they bind to their DNA targets. The trisaccharide moiety is essential for dimer formation |CITS: [8329387][7666419][ 8422355][1731073]|, while the disaccharide interacts with the phosphate backbone of the DNA.

COMMENT - The megalomicins, which were discovered in 1968 |CITS:[5735370][5810991]|, are a family of related macrolide antibiotics produced by the soil bacterium |FRAME: TAX-47868|. They are therapeutically diverse compounds that possess antiparasitic, antiviral and antibacterial properties. Like other macrolide antibiotics, they are more active against Gram-positive bacteria than against Gram-negative bacteria |CITS: [4390258][4996819]|.
/
/The first family member to have its structure reported was |FRAME: CPD-12966| |CITS: [5358619][5358620]|.  Acyl derivatives of |FRAME: CPD-12966|, including |FRAME: CPD-14689|, |FRAME: CPD-12967|, |FRAME: CPD-14691|, and |FRAME: CPD-14690|, were soon discovered |CITS: [4795255]|.
/
/The megalomicins have the same aglycone as |FRAME: CPD-13804| and |FRAME: CPD-13951|, but include a unique deoxyamino sugar, |FRAME: CPD-14692|, at the C-6 hydroxyl.

COMMON-NAME - a diacylglycerol(18:2/16:0)
COMMENT - This class of diacylglycerols contains two acyl chains formed by the esterification of glycerol with two fatty acids. One acyl chain has 18 carbons and two double bonds. The other acyl chain has 16 carbons and zero double bonds. The location and orientation of the double bonds present in the unsaturated acyl chain(s) may differ between different members of this class of compound. Similarly, the attachment sites of the acyl chains at the R1   (<i>sn</i>-1), R2 (<i>sn</i>-2), or R3 (<i>sn</i>-3) position may vary. In all members of the class the R group not associated with an acyl chain represents a hydrogen.
/
/The name of this compound class provides information about the two acyl chains found in each member of the class using the nomenclature DAG(a:b/y:z) where "a" represents the number of carbons found in one acyl chain and "b" represents the number of desaturations present in chain "a" and where  "y" represents the number of carbons found in the other acyl chain and "z" represents the number of desaturations present in chain "y." The order in which "a:b" and "x:y" appear in the name do not provide evidence concerning their relative positions along the glyceryl backbone.

UNIQUE-ID - Glucosyl-ceramides
TYPES - Ceramides
COMMON-NAME - a glucosylceramide
COMMENT - Glucosyl ceramides are a type of sphingolipid. Each member of this class has a long carbon chain attached at position R1 to form a long chain base and a long carbon chain is attached at position R2 to form a fatty amide. Either or both of these chains may contain one or more double bonds and may have hydroxyl groups attached.
/
/Based on the notation GlcCer(m:n)-p used to name subclasses of glucosylceramides, the total number of carbons present in the sphingoid base and the fatty amide is "m" while the total number of double bonds is "n." The total number of hydroxyl groups (not including the hydroxyl group used as the site of the head group attachment) is "p." The length, hydroxylation position, double bond position, and double bond orientation of the groups attached at R1 and R2 will differ between individual members of this group of compounds.

UNIQUE-ID - Adenine-Cytokinins
TYPES - Cytokinins
COMMON-NAME - an adenine-type cytokinin
COMMENT - Cytokinins are a class of plant hormones that promote cell division, or cytokinesis, in plant roots and shoots. While their main role is to control cell growth and differentiation, they also affect apical dominance, axillary bud growth, and leaf senescence.
/
/The cytokinins are structurally diverse, and have been divided into two main types: |FRAME: Adenine-Cytokinins "adenine-type cytokinins"| and |FRAME: Phenylurea-Cytokinins "phenylurea-type cytokinins"|. All the natural cytokinins fall into the first type - phenylurea-type cytokinins are synthetic.
/
/The adenine cytokinins are classified further by the configuration of their N6-side chain as isoprenoid or aromatic cytokinins. The most prevalent cytokinins are by far those with an unsaturated isoprenoid side chain, and in particular those with a <i>trans</i>-hydroxylated N6-side chain, such as |FRAME: CPD-4210| and its derivatives.
/
/Most of the adenine-type cytokinins are modified by glucosylation of the adenine ring at the 3-, the 7-, or 9-position and conjugation of alanine at the 9-position of zeatin, forming lupinic acid. With the exception of the 3-glucosides, the <i>N</i>-glucosyl and alanyl conjugates generally exhibit no or low activity.
/
/The most important modifications are those affecting the N6-side chain, where even small substitutions have pronounced effects on cytokinin activity. The most common modifications of the side chain include reduction (e.g. trans-zeatin to dihydrozeatin), conjugation to O-glycosides (O-glucosides and O-xylosides), and side chain cleavage by cytokinin oxidases |CITS: [11337393]|.

COMMENT - Jasmonic acid is an important phytohormone. Four different stereoisomers of this compound exist, based on the

/forms.
/
/Only two of the stereoisomers occur naturally:
/|FRAME: CPD-731| and |FRAME: CPD-734| |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. These two forms are present in equilibrium
/within cells and can interconvert spontaneously through epimerization |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. The exact ratio of these stereoisomers
/within a cell has not been conclusively determined, and it may vary based on species, cell type, and physiological state. But,
/in the systems tested so far, |FRAME: CPD-734| is found at higher levels than |FRAME: CPD-731| |CITS:[19349968]|.
/
/The biological activity of these stereoisomers can be quite different |CITS: [8074303]|. In addition, enzymes involved in JA

/species |CITS: [18812165][SEMBDER93][17273867]|. There are two different naturally occurring stereoisomers of this
/compound, |FRAME: CPD-11232| and |FRAME:CPD-11259|, that can spontaneously interconvert through epimerization
/|CITS: [19349968]|. 
/
/In Arabidopsis thaliana, JA-Ile promotes binding between the COI1 F-box protein and the JAZ1 repressor involved
/in jasmonic acid-mediated signaling |CITS: [17637677]|. Therefore, JA-Ile promotes the degradation of JAZ1.
/Initial studies suggested that |FRAME: CPD-11232 "(-)-JA-Ile"| was a biologically active phytohormone
/|CITS: [SEMBDER93][17291501]|. However,
/later work shows that |FRAME: CPD-11259| is the biologically active form of the compound |CITS: [19349968
/]|. This compound exists at low levels in most commercial preparations of |FRAME: CPD-11232| and may explain the observed
/biological activity originally associated with |FRAME: CPD-11232 "(-)-JA-Ile"|. A pure preparation of that stereoisomer
/does not promote JAZ/COI1 binding <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [19349968]|.

COMMON-NAME - an NRPS containing a [peptidyl-carrier-protein] domain
COMMENT - Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are typically polyfunctional modular megasynthases found
/mainly in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes, and participate in assembly line biosynthesis of
/peptide-based natural products, such as the antibiotic vancomycin and the siderophore enterobactin.
/The minimal NRPS module consists of condensation, adenylation, and peptidyl carrier protein
/(PCP) domains.
/
/The adenylation domain recognizes and activates the amino acid substrate through the formation of
/an aminoacyl adenylate, followed by covalent binding of the activated amino acid as a thioester to the
/|FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| of the PCP domain. The condensation domain catalyzes peptide-bond
/formation between 2 adjacent modules by facilitating the attack of an upstream peptidyl-PCP donor
/by a downstream chain-elongation unit, an aminoacyl-PCP acceptor nucleophile.
/
/PCPs are not limited to NRPSs. For example, D-alanyl carrier protein (Dcp) is a discrete PCP that
/contributes to the peptidoglycan cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, and is required for the formation of
/D-alanyl-lipoteichoic acid |CITS: [18059524]|.

/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to
/as |FRAME: FeS-Centers|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential.
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into three groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. The first group consists of monomeric proteins containing one [2Fe-2S] cluster, which includes ferredoxins
/that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms
/(from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers
/in photosynthesis. The other two groups consist of ubiquitous proteins containing [3Fe-4S]/ [4Fe-4S] and are typically found in bacteria.
/They may differ in cluster type (3Fe or 4Fe), number (one or two), and length of polypeptide chain
/(up to over 100 residues), and include the relatively small 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins that were first isolated from
/anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [16466637]|.

/Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.

Further characterization of Trx1 <i>in vitro</i> has shown that it can reduce the disulfides that are formed during catalysis by a range of enzymes, including |FRAME: PAPSSULFOTRANS-CPLX| |CITS: [7016827]| and |FRAME: EG11433-MONOMER "methionine sulfoxide reductase"| (Msr) |CITS: [4392601]|. <i>In vivo</i> experiments with |FRAME: TAX-562| mutant strains have confirmed these observations |CITS: [11544348]|. In addition, thioredoxin 1 can also transfer electrons to  the membrane protein |FRAME: DSBD-MONOMER|, which in turn transfers them to the periplasmic protein disulfide isomerases/oxidoreductases encoded by |FRAME: EG11070| and |FRAME: G6333| |CITS: [12004064]|. 
/
/Trx1 is also required for the assembly of the filamentous |FRAME: TAX-562| phages f1, T7 and M13, though this function is not related to its redox properties |CITS: [3533930]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Red-thioredoxins-2
TYPES - Red-Thioredoxin
TYPES - Thioredoxin-B
COMMON-NAME - a reduced thioredoxin 2
COMMENT - Several types of thioredoxins were identified in bacteria.
/Thioredoxin 2 (Trx2) was first identified in E. coli. It contains two distinct domains: a C-terminal domain with the conserved WCGPC active site signature and an additional N-terminal domain of 32 residues which includes two conserved CXXC motifs |CITS: [9388228]| responsible for the tight binding of a zinc atom |CITS: [12952960]|.
/
/<i>In vitro</i> studies showed that E. coli Trx2 is a functional Trx, as it is capable of reducing insulin and ribonucleotide reductase and is an electron donor for 3?-phosphoadenylylsulfate reductase |CITS: [9388228][10075658]|. <i>In vivo</i>, Trx2 can substitute for Trx1 function, but only when Trx2 is overexpressed.
/
/The crystal structure of Trx2 from Rhodobacter capsulatus was determined, confirming that the fold of the C-terminal domain is similar to that of Trx1 |CITS: [17913712]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Reduced-flavodoxins
TYPES - Flavodoxin
COMMON-NAME - a reduced flavodoxin
COMMENT - Flavodoxin (Fld) is a soluble electron shuttle flavoprotein (it binds a flavin mononucleotide) that is isofunctional with |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxin| (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal electron acceptors of |FRAME: CPLX490-3509|.
/
/Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity. 
/Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+ reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR). The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by |FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.
/
/Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. Fld can substitute Fd under conditions of iron deprivation in most cyanobacteria and some algae and may be efficient in reducing most or all of these soluble enzymes |CITS: [11687213]|.

COMMON-NAME - post-translational protein modification
COMMENT - This term should only be used to annotate a protein modification process that occurs after the protein has been released from the ribosome, and is therefore strictly post-translational. Modification of a free protein (one not attached to a ribosome) and modification of a C-terminal residue are post-translational processes. Some protein modifications occur while the protein is still in the ribosome but before translation has been completed; these modification processes are considered co-translational and should not be annotated using this term.

UNIQUE-ID - Ibuprofen
TYPES - Monocarboxylates
COMMON-NAME - ibuprofen
COMMENT - Ibuprofen is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for pain relief, fever reduction, and against swelling.
/Like other NSAID drugs (e.g. |FRAME: CPD-524| and |FRAME: CPD-7669|), ibuprofen works by inhibiting the enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.14.99.1| (also known as cyclooxygenase or COX) that converts |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| to |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2|, a precursor to other prostaglandins that mediate pain, inflammation, and fever. In addition, |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2| is also a precursor of |FRAME: ALPHA11-ALPHA-EPOXY-15-HYDROXYTHROMBA|, which stimulates platelet aggregation. The inhibition of the COX1 variant of the COX cyclooxygenase also reduces the formation of blood clots.
/Ibuprofen inhibits both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, |FRAME: HS01815| (COX1) and |FRAME: HS01115| (COX2).
/
/Ibuprofen was derived from |FRAME: PROPIONATE| during the 1960s. Originally marketed as Brufen, ibuprofen is available under a variety of popular trademarks, including Motrin, Nurofen, Advil, Nuprin and many others.
/
/The active form of ibuprofen is |FRAME: CPD-15516|. The drug is synthesized as a racemic mixture, but an isomerase encoded by the |FRAME: HS01416| gene converts the inactive |FRAME: CPD-15517 "(R)-form"| <i>in vivo</i> to the active form via a coenzyme A derivative |CITS: [9106621]|.

Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.
/
/<b>About nomenclature</b>: Several nomenclatures are used for unsaturated fatty acids, and are not complementary. Systematic names (or IUPAC names) begin counting the carbon atoms from the carboxylic acid end, and the double bonds are labelled with <i>cis</i>/<i>trans</i> or E/Z notation, e.g. 8<i>E</i>,10<i>E</i>,12<i>Z</i>-octadecatrienoate. However, unsaturated fatty acids are often described using the omega nomenclature, which begins counting the carbon atoms from the terminal methyl carbon (designated as <i>n</i> or &omega;).
/In addition, unsaturated fatty acids are often referred to by trivial names, or by the "lipid number" as in 18:3, where 18 is the number of carbons, and 3 is the number of double bonds. This notation is ambiguous, as it does not specify the location of the double bonds.

UNIQUE-ID - Hemicelluloses
TYPES - Polysaccharides
COMMON-NAME - hemicellulose
COMMENT - Please note that hemicellulose is a not a precise biological term.
/
/The plant cell wall is composed of |FRAME: CELLULOSE| and many additional complex polymers.
/Unlike cellulose, which is crystalline and resistant to hydrolysis, the other polymers are amorphous and are easily hydrolyzed by dilute acid or base.
/
/Hemicellulose is a heterogeneous term that is used for all the plant cell wall components that are soluble in dilute alkali solutions, or that go into solution quite readily in hot dilute mineral acids with the formation of simple sugars. The term is often used to describe all the polysaccharide components of the cell wall other than cellulose.
/
/Hemicelluloses constitute about one-fourth of perennial plants and about one-third of annual plants. Since the term does not refer to a particular chemical entity, hemicelluloses extracted from different plant sources are rarely identical. 
/However, D-xylose is the dominant building unit of the hemicelluloses of most woods and annual plants. D-xylose occurs as the polymer |FRAME: Xylans|, as derivatives of xylan, such as |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans glucuronoxylan| and |FRAME: Arabinoxylan arabinoxylan|, and as side chains on other types of backbones, such as |FRAME: Xyloglucan xyloglucan| and |FRAME: Xylogalacturonan xylogalacturonan|.
/D-Mannose is also very abundant, and occurs as the polymer |FRAME: Mannan mannan| or in combination with D-glucose or D-galactose as |FRAME: Glucomannans glucomannans|, |FRAME: Galactomannans galactomannan|, or |FRAME: Galactoglucomannans galactoglucomannan|. Arabinose is common as well, either in the form of |FRAME: Arabinans "L-arabinan"| or in the form of side chains on other polysaccharides.
/
/Other sugars common in hemicellulose include |FRAME: Galactose galactose|, |FRAME: Rhamnose rhamnose|, |FRAME: Galacturonate galacturonate| and |FRAME: Mannuronate mannuronate|.
/
/Hemicellulose consists of shorter chains than cellulose, typically 500 - 3,000 sugar units, and is usually branched.

While they are protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attacks, they also induce a strong response from animal immune systems. 
/Lipopolysaccharides contain three parts: a lipid (lipid A), a core polysaccharide, and polysaccharide (<i>O</i>) side chains.
/
/The side chain is referred to as an <i>O</i>-antigen. The composition of the O-antigen varies among different strains, but in general it consists of repeating oligosaccharide subunits made up of three to five sugars. At least 20 different sugars are known to occur, and many of these sugars are unique dideoxyhexoses that are rarely found elsewhere in nature. The variations in sugar content of the O-antigens contribute to the wide variety of antigenic types between species and even strains of Gram-negative bacteria |CITS: [12007641]|.
/
/The presence or absence of O chains determines whether the LPS is considered rough or smooth. In addition, particular sugars in the structure, especially the terminal ones, confer immunological specificity of the O-antigen, in addition to the "smoothness" of the strain.

The names of triacylglycerol compound classes provide information about the three acyl chains of each member of the class, using the nomenclature TAG(a:b/y:z) where "a" represents the number of carbons found in one acyl chain and "b" represents the number of desaturations present in chain "a" and where  "y" represents the total number of carbons found in the other two acyl chains and "z" represents the total number of desaturations present in the two chains included in "y." 
/
/Therefore, in this TAG(18:3/40:4) class of compounds, one acyl chain has 18 carbons and three double bonds. The other two acyl chains have a total of 40 carbons and four double bonds. The attachment sites of the acyl chains at the R1 (sn-1), R2 (sn-2), or R3 (sn-3) position along the glyceryl backbone may vary among class members and cannot be inferred from their order in the compound class name. Additionally, the location and orientation of the double bonds in the unsaturated acyl chain(s) may vary among members of the class and are not specified by this notation.

/tRNA and the largest tRNA in <i>E. coli</i> and other organisms. It is charged by seryl-tRNA synthase, but the
/immediate product seryl-tRNA<sup>sec</sup> does not insert serine residues at UGA codons in the process of
/translation.  Only after it has been converted to selenocysteyl-tRNA<sup>sec</sup> does it recognize UGA. Then a
/selenocysteine residue is inserted. tRNA<sup>sec</sup> is essential for synthesizing active selenoproteins, of which
/ <i>E. coli</i> has three |CITS: [1702199]|.

TYPES - Cytochromes-c550
COMMON-NAME - a reduced cytochrome <i>c550</i>
COMMENT - Cytochrome <i>c550</i> is an essential component of the quinoprotein ethanol oxidation system that occurs in Pseudomonas and Rhodopseudomonas. 
/The gene encoding the cytochrome, which was named exaB, has been studied in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The deduced amino acid sequence of that gene showed some similarity to cytochrome c6 of the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and to the heme binding  domain of quinohaemoprotein alcohol dehydrogenases of acetic acid bacteria |CITS: [10075429]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Cytochromes-CL-Red
TYPES - Cytochromes-C-Reduced
TYPES - Cytochromes-CL
COMMON-NAME - a reduced cytochrome <i>c</i><sub>L</sub>
COMMENT - Cytochrome <i>c</i><sub>L</sub> is a relatively large (about 19 kDa) acidic cytochrome that is specifically involved in electron transfer from the quinoprotein methanol dehydrogenase |CITS: [6263253][6295363]|.
/Despite its relatively large size it contains only one heme. Its amino acid suggests that it is completely different, except for its heme-binding site, from all other cytochromes |CITS: [2851998]|.
/
/The cytochrome <i>c</i><sub>L</sub> has been cloned and studied from several methylotrophic bacteria, including |FRAME: TAX-272630| |CITS: [3129405][2842733]| and |FRAME: TAX-266| |CITS: [1657871]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Cytochromes-C552-Red
TYPES - Cytochromes-C-Reduced
TYPES - Cytochromes-C552
COMMON-NAME - a reduced cytochrome <i>c552</i>
COMMENT - The cytochrome <i>c552</i> family includes periplasmic cytochromes that function in nitrite reduction in Gram-negative bacteria such as enteric bacteria, Shewanella and Vibrio.
/The enzyme, which is encoded by the nrfA gene, covalently binds five |FRAME: HEME_C| groups and one |FRAME: CA+2| ion per monomer |CITS: [9593308]|.  
/It is believed that the cytochrome <i>c</i> encoded by the nrfB gene is responsible for the direct transfer of electrons to cytochrome <i>c552</i>.  The reduced cytochrome <i>c552</i> can then directly reduce nitrite to ammonia.
/Formate, pyruvate, ethanol, and D-lactate can serve as electron donors |CITS: [5338848][6381645][8409924] [7934939] [8057835][8039676]|.
/
/The cytochrome <i>c552</i> from |FRAME: TAX-915| is a misnamed 9.1-kDa monoheme protein and does not belong to this family. It belongs to the cytochrome <i>c551</i> |CITS: [9746537]|.

COMMON-NAME - a reduced 2[4Fe-4s] ferredoxin
COMMENT - Ferredoxins are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes.
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to as |FRAME: FeS-Centers|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential.
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. 
/
/In [4Fe-4S] ferredoxins the Fe ions are ligated by four |FRAME: CYS| residues that occur in a -C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-X<sub>n</sub>- pattern. This pattern is duplicated in ferredoxins that contain two [4Fe-4S] clusters.

COMMENT - D-Glucose is an extremely abundant monosaccharide that is used as an energy source in most organisms, from bacteria to humans. In humans D-glucose is the key source of energy, through aerobic respiration, but other organisms can also metabolize glucose by anaerobic respiration and fermentation.
/
/D-Glucose is also one of the main products of photosynthesis, and is used as a precursor for the synthesis of several important substances, such as cellulose and chitin. Many organisms store glucose as an energy and carbon reserve in the form of plymers such as  starch and glycogen.
/
/In addition, D-glucose is often added onto certain proteins and lipids through glycosylation, which is often critical for their functioning.

/Even though fatty acids derived from natural fats and oils, such as |FRAME:CPD-195|, are usually at least 8 carbon atoms long, carboxylic acids as short as |FRAME:BUTYRIC_ACID| (4 carbon atoms) are considered to be fatty acids.

When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. |FRAME: Polyunsaturated-fatty-acids "Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)"| are fatty acids that contain more than one double bond in their backbone. This class includes many important compounds, such as essential fatty acids and those that give drying oils their characteristic property.
/
/<b>About nomenclature</b>: Several nomenclatures are used for unsaturated fatty acids, and are not complementary. Systematic names (or IUPAC names) begin counting the carbon atoms from the carboxylic acid end, and the double bonds are labelled with <i>cis</i>/<i>trans</i> or E/Z notation, e.g. 8<i>E</i>,10<i>E</i>,12<i>Z</i>-octadecatrienoate. However, unsaturated fatty acids are often described using the omega nomenclature, which begins counting the carbon atoms from the terminal methyl carbon (designated as <i>n</i> or &omega;).
/In addition, unsaturated fatty acids are often referred to by trivial names, or by the "lipid number" as in 18:3, where 18 is the number of carbons, and 3 is the number of double bonds. This notation is ambiguous, as it does not specify the location of the double bonds.

UNIQUE-ID - PENICILLIN
TYPES - Penams
COMMON-NAME - a penicillin
COMMENT - Penicillins are medically important |FRAME: Beta-Lactams "&beta;-lactam"| antibiotics biosynthesized as end products by certain filamentous fungi, including |FRAME: TAX-5076| and |FRAME: TAX-162425|.
/
/&Beta;-Lactam antibiotics inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall by the irreversible binding of their four-membered &beta;-lactam ring to the so-called |FRAME: Penicillin-Binding-Proteins "Penicillin binding proteins"| (PBPs).
/The PBPs are proteins that contain a D,D-peptidase domain, most commonly used for hydrolyzing the |FRAME: D-ALA-D-ALA| bond found in the pentapetide moiety of peptidoglycans. Since the &beta;-lactam moiety of |FRAME: PENICILLIN "penicillins"| is similar to the D-Ala-D-Ala structure, these enzymes bind penicillin irreversibly and become inactive.
/Several groups of enzymes belong to this family - carboxypeptidases, transpeptidases, and endopeptidases. The carboxypeptidase remove the terminal |FRAME: D-ALANINE| from the pentapeptide, the transpeptidase form crosslinks between the pentapeptides of adjacent glycan threads, and the endopeptidases hydrolyze these crosslinks.
/This irrevesible binding prevents the enzyme from catalyzing the formation of these cross-links, resulting in a defective cell wall and cell death.
/
/Penicillin antibiotics were the first drugs that were effective against many previously serious diseases, such as syphilis, and infections caused by staphylococci and streptococci. They are still widely used today, although more and more types of bacteria have acquired resistance.

COMMON-NAME - a UDP-<i>N</i>-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide
COMMENT - The peptide moiety, which is bound through its N terminus to the carboxyl group of muramate and
/contains alternating L and D amino acids, reveals considerable variation.
/The amino acid linked directly to muramate is usually |FRAME:L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, but in some cases
/can be replaced by |FRAME: GLY| or |FRAME: SER| |CITS: [5777324][5965240][4385976][6029599]
/[5704800][5469569][6033749]|.
/
/The most common amino acid in the second position is |FRAME: D-GLT|, but in some cases (in a few
/coryneform bacteria) it is hydroxylated to |FRAME: CPD-48| |CITS: [6072398]|. In some organisms the
/&alpha;-carboxyl group of |FRAME: D-GLT| is modified by amidation or substituted by |FRAME: GLY|
/|CITS: [5965232][6064598]|, by |FRAME: GLYCINAMIDE| |CITS: [Interschick70]|, or by |FRAME: CPD0-1578|
/|CITS: [4683671]|.
/
/The greatest variation occurs at position 3. The residue at this position is usually a diamino acid and is
/involved in cross-linking through the second amino group. The most common
/residue at this position is |FRAME: MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE|, which is present in probably all
/Gram-negative bacteria and in many other organisms, such as some species of bacilli, clostridia,
/lactobacilli, corynebacteria, propionibacteria, Actinomycetales, Myxobacteriales, Rickettsiae, and
/cyanobacteria |CITS: [410379][6131881]| (see |FRAME:PEPTIDOGLYCANSYN-PWY|).
/The second common residue at this position is |FRAME: LYS|, but other substituition have been
/documented, including |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| |CITS: [4884715][14152785][6035494][6031807]|,
/|FRAME:LL-DIAMINOPIMELATE| |CITS: [14024243][13882624][13525638][11945321]|,
/|FRAME: CPD-7690| |CITS: [5870104]|, and |FRAME: 5-HYDROXY-L-LYSINE| |CITS: [16562051]|. 
/In some cases the diamino acid in position 3 is not involved in cross linking. In these cases
/the residue in position 3 can be |FRAME: N-ACETYL-L-24-DIAMINOBUTANOATE|, as in the case of
/<i>Clavibacter michiganensis</i> |CITS: [5704800][5119774]|, or even a monoamino acid, such as
/|FRAME:L-ALPHA-ALANINE| |FRAME: GLT| |CITS: [4259817]| or |FRAME: HOMO-SER|
/|CITS: [5119774][5119774 ][5469569]|.
/
/Position 4 and 5 are almost always occupied by |FRAME: D-ALA-D-ALA| di-peptide. In several species
/enterococci and lactobacilli, the terminal |FRAME:D-ALANINE| is replaced by |FRAME:D-LACTATE|
/|CITS: [1503450]| or |FRAME:D-SERINE| |CITS: [8852545]|, which entails resistance to the glycopeptide

COMMENT - Gentamicins are a family of |FRAME: Aminoglycoside-Antibiotics "aminoglycoside antibiotics"| produced by Gram-positive bacteria of the |FRAME: TAX-1873| genus. They were discovered in 1963 by a group of scientists at the Schering Corporation |CITS: [14274893]|.
/
/Gentamicins are particularly active against Gram-negative bacteria, and are bactericidal. They act by binding the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, interrupting protein synthesis. Despite their high antibacterial activity, intravenous use is limited by their ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. However, they are used commonly as a topical treatment to skin infections. The most common form of gentamycin is the C complex, which consists of a mixture of |FRAME: CPD-14213|, |FRAME: CPD-14216|, |FRAME: CPD-14211| and |FRAME: CPD-14212|.

COMMON-NAME - a kanamycin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Kanamycins Kanamycins| are a group of |FRAME: Aminoglycoside-Antibiotics "aminoglycoside antibiotics"| produced by the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1967|. The compounds were discovered in 1957 by researchers in the National Institute of Health of Tokyo, Japan |CITS: [13513509][13595489]|. Due to their wide range of activity, especially against severe staphylococcal and mycobacterial infections, these antibiotics gained almost immediate acceptance, and the most common form, |FRAME: CPD-4821|, was produced commercially within a year of its discovery |CITS: [13566481]|.
/
/Kanamycins interact with the 30S subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome, inducing substantial amounts of mistranslation and indirectly inhibiting translocation during protein synthesis, resulting in death |CITS: [391568][9662506]|. Kanamycins are currently used to treat a wide variety of infections.
/
/Kanamycins share several biosynthetic intermediates with other aminoglycosides, including the core moiety |FRAME: CPD-10151| and the pseudodisaccharides |FRAME: CPD-14126|, |FRAME: CPD-14125| and |FRAME: CPD-14137|.
/
/While the main product produced by |FRAME: TAX-1967| is |FRAME: CPD-4821| (R1 = NH2; R2 = OH), additional products are also produced, including |FRAME: CPD-4822| (R1 = R2 = NH<sub>2</sub>), |FRAME: CPD-4823| (R1 = OH; R2 = NH<sub>2</sub>) |CITS: [13563334][13587408]|, |FRAME: CPD-14138| (similar to |FRAME: CPD-4821|, but contains a glucose moiety instead of the kinosamine moiety) |CITS: [Adams96]| and |FRAME: CPD-4824| (R1 = R2 = OH) |CITS: [Chang80]|.

The lividomycins were discovered In Japan in the early 70s |CITS: [5091208][5092785][5092786][ 4624613][4647833]|. Like other aminoglucoside antibiotics, it inhibits protein synthesis by binding to 16S ribosomal RNA |CITS: [4945812][4586150]|. 
/
/Despite promising initial results against urinary tract infections |CITS: [4579561][4579564][4203572]|, tuberculosis |CITS:[4721804][4142798]| and other respiratory tract infections |CITS: [807755][1041282]|, lividomycin never became widely used.

UNIQUE-ID - Neomycins
TYPES - Deoxystreptamine-Antib
COMMON-NAME - a neomycin
COMMENT - Neomycins are a family of broad-spectrum highly toxic antibiotics produced by |FRAME: TAX-1906|. They were discovered in 1949 by Waksman and Lechevalier (Waksman later received the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physiology and medicine) |CITS: [17782716]|.
/
/Neomycin usually exists as a complex composed of two stereoisomers, |FRAME: CPD-14142| and |FRAME: CPD-14141|, which are the two active components. A third component, |FRAME: CPD-14137 "neomycin A"|, which is a degradation product, is present in small quantities.
/
/Neomycin was originally used as a treatment for tuberculosis, but serious side effects soon became apparent, including ototoxicity |CITS: [8170691]|, which sometimes developed to complete loss of hearing, and nephrotoxicity. Thus systemic use of neomycin is limited, and the most common mode of use is via topical application |CITS: [6224608]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Butirosins
TYPES - Deoxystreptamine-Antib
COMMON-NAME - a butirosin
COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-14140 "Butirosins A"| and |FRAME: CPD-14193| are naturally occurring derivatives of the |FRAME: Aminoglycoside-Antibiotics "2-aminoglycoside antibiotics"| |FRAME: CPD-14196| and |FRAME: CPD-14143|, respectively, produced by the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1397| and discovered in the early 1970s |CITS: [4207954][4670491][4670492]|.
/
/The butirosins are unique among naturally occurring aminoglycosides since they contain an (<i>S</i>)-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyrate (AHBA) side-chain at the C-1 amine of the central 2-deoxystreptamine ring. This modification has been shown to confer resistance against several aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (the C-1 amine is a frequent target of aminoglycoside N-acyltransferases). As a result, the butirosins are active toward many aminoglycoside-resistant strains.
/
/Although the butirosins are not themselves clinically useful drugs, the properties of their side-chain have led to successful synthetic alteration of |FRAME: CPD-4822| and |FRAME: CPD-14161| to produce |FRAME: CPD-14197| and |FRAME: CPD-14162|, respectively |CITS: [62814][Watanabe87a]|.

COMMENT - Xyloglucan is the major hemicellulose in dicotyledon type I cell walls and has a backbone of &beta;-1,4-linked cellotetraose units, which are substituted in C-6 by a-D-xylosyl residues at two or three of the first three glucosyl residues (from the reducing end) |CITS: [8252539]|. Some of the xylosyl residues are further substituted by galactosyl, arabinosyl or fucosyls residues |CITS: [Fry93]|. The cross-linking between xyloglucan chains is a major factor in the stability of the three-dimensional matrix between adjacent cellulose microfibrils |CITS: [Whitney95]|.
/
/
/A common terminology refers to a glucosyl unit within a xylosylglycan as G and to a glucose residues substituted by D-xylose in a (1,6)-&alpha;-linkage as X.
/Using this terminology, most xylosylglucans consist of repeating heptasaccharide XXXG units.
/Subsequently (1,2)-&beta;-D-galactosyl residues are added at the second and/or third xylose residue and an(1,2)-&alpha;-L-fucose is added at the galactosyl unit of the third xylose residue |CITS:[12837954] [17011813]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Xylans
TYPES - Hemicelluloses
COMMON-NAME - xylan
COMMENT - Xylan is a general name given for polysaccharides composed of xylose residues. It is the principal type of |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| in plant biomass representing the second most abundant polysaccharide in the biosphere after |FRAME: CELLULOSE| |CITS: [20113432]|.
/
/The most common form of xylan is |FRAME: 1-4-beta-Xylan|, which is found in the cell walls of plants and some algae. 
/Pure |FRAME: 1-4-beta-Xylan "(1&rarr;4)-&beta;-D-xylan"| is uncommon. In most cases it is decorated with additional sugars, in the form of |FRAME: Arabinoxylan arabinoxylan|, |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans glucuronoxylan|, |FRAME: Glucuronoarabinoxylans glucuronoarabinoxylan| or |FRAME: Arabinoglucuronoxylans arabinoglucuronoxylan|.
/
/The secondary hydroxyl groups on xylose carbons 2 and 3 can be substituted by a number of residues, the type and degree of substitution depending on xylan's botanical source. Arabinose and glucuronic acid are linked to the backbone by glycosidic bonds. Other substituents form ester bonds: acetate groups are bound directly to the backbone, while cinnamoyl (feruloyl and coumaroyl) residues are linked to the side chain arabinoses |CITS: [JOSELEAU]|.
/
/Due to its heterogeneous structure, the biodegradation of xylan requires the concerted action of a complex set of enzymes |CITS: [17008082]|. These enzymes are mainly extracellular and are secreted by numerous fungi and bacteria |CITS: [BIELY]|. The endoxylanases and &beta; xylosidases hydrolyze the main chain; the former generating short chain oligosaccharides and the latter acting on these products to liberate xylose. The side chains are hydrolyzed by glycanases, &alpha;-glucuronidases, acetyl xylan esterases and feruloyl esterases |CITS: [11729262]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Xyloglucan Xyloglucan| is the major component of the |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| in cell walls of dicotyledon type I and non-graminaceous monocotyledon plants. It also exists in some seeds of trees growing in the tropical zone.
/
/Xyloglucan interacts with cellulose microfibrils via hydrogen bonds to form a structural network that is assumed to play a key role in cell wall integrity. Cross-linking between the xyloglucan chains is a major factor in the stability of the resulting three-dimensional matrix |CITS: [Whitney95]|.
/
/Xyloglucan has a backbone of &beta;-1,4-linked glucose residues, most of which are substituted in C-6 by &alpha;-D-xylosyl residues |CITS: [8252539]|. In most plants some of the xylosyl residues are further substituted by (1,2)-&beta;-D-galactosyl residues, and some of the galactosyl residues are capped by (1,2)-&alpha;-L-fucose |CITS:[12837954] [17011813]|. Other types of xyloglucans, for example those found in the Poaeceae and Solanaceae, feature xylose units that bear &alpha;-L-arabinosyl instead of &beta;-D-galactosyl residues.
/
/A common terminology uses G for basic non-substituted glucosyl units within a xylosylglycan, X for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose, L for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose and &beta;-D-galactose, and F for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose, &beta;-D-galactose and &alpha;-L-fucose |CITS:[Fry93]|.
/Fucosyl residues are typically absent from seed xyloglucans but present on the xyloglucans in the vegatative portions of the same plant |CITS: [Mishra09]|.
/
/Most xylosylglucans consist of repeating heptasaccharide |FRAME: Xyloglucans-Xylose XXXG| units. The average molecular weight of xyloglucan is more than 50,000  |CITS: [Mishra09]|.
/
/A common form of xyloglucan that is often used in enzyme assays is produced from tamarind (|FRAME: TAX-58860|) seeds.

/The extent of galactosylation varies greatly, and the mannose : galactose ratio is one of the main characteristics of the polymer as it determines their physicochemical properties, such as solubility in water, density, and the viscosity of the solution |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|. On one hand, slightly galactosylated linear mannans (about 4% galactose), have been isolated from the seed endosperm of vegetable ivory nut (|FRAME: TAX-115507|) and date (|FRAME: TAX-42345|). They are water-insoluble, resemble cellulose in conformation of the individual molecular chains, and occur in cellulose microfibrils of the plant tissues |CITS: [Reid95]|.
/
/On the other hand, heavily galactosylated polymers (up to 96%) are abundant in the cell walls of storage tissues (endosperm, cotyledons, perisperm) of many seeds. Those from the endosperm of some leguminous seeds, such as guar (|FRAME: TAX-3832|), locust bean or carob (|FRAME: TAX-20340|), and tara gum (|FRAME: TAX-191904|), are widely used commercially |CITS: [Reid95]|.
/
/Another important feature is the distribution of the galactopyranose residues along the mannan backbone, which affects the molecular interactions of the chains among themselves (self-association) and with other polysaccharides (cooperative associations) in solution |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Glucomannans Glucomannans| (GM), along with |FRAME: Galactoglucomannans galactoglucomannans| (GGM), are the major hemicellulosic components of the secondary cell walls of softwoods, but occur only in minor amounts in the secondary cell walls of hardwoods. 
/|FRAME: Glucomannans Glucomannans| consist of a backbone composed of &beta;(1&rarr;4)-linked glucopyranose and mannopyranose residues, and are often branched. Unlike GMs, GGM chains are substituted by galactopyranose residues.
/Glucomannans show some variations in structural features depending on the plant species and stage of plant development |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.
/
/Low-molecular-weight GMs, acetylated at position 2 or 3 of some mannopyranose residues, were isolated from aspen and birch wood |CITS: [12668108]|. 
/Soluble, often partially acetylated GMs occur as constituents of bulbs, tubers, seeds, roots, and leaves of some non-gramineousmonocotyl plants. An example are the GMs from plants of the genus |FRAME: TAX-25641|, which are known for their medicinal value. A GM from the potato-like plant |FRAME: TAX-78372| is known as konjac mannan in Japanese food applications.
/Studies of konjac mannan showed that is is branched (8%), with branches joined through the C-6 position of only the glucose residues. Both glucopyranose and mannopyranose residues (in the ratio of 1 : 2) were suggested to terminate the branches |CITS: [Katsuraya03]|.

/
/AGs occur in two structurally different forms described as |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-I "type I"| and |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-II "type II"|.
/
/AG of type I has a linear (1&rarr;4)-&beta;-D-Galp backbone, bearing 20-40% of &alpha;-L-Araf residues (1&rarr;5)-linked in short chains, in general at position 3. It is commonly found in pectins from citrus, apple and potato. Type I AG has been isolated from the skin of Opuntia ficus indica pear fruits |CITS: [15063212]|.
/
/AG of type II, known as arabino-3,6-galactan, has a (1&rarr;3)-&beta;-D-Galp backbone heavily substituted at position 6 by mono- and oligosaccharide side chains composed of arabinosyl and galactosyl units.

UNIQUE-ID - Dermatan-Sulfate
TYPES - Glycosaminoglycans
COMMON-NAME - dermatan sulfate
COMMENT - |FRAME: Dermatan-Sulfate "Dermatan sulfate"| is a sulfated |FRAME: Glycosaminoglycans "glycosaminoglycan"| composed of repeating disaccharide units of variable composition.
/Dermatan sulfate is expressed in many mammalian tissues and is the predominant glycan present in skin. Dermatan and dermatan sulfate proteoglycans have also been implicated in cardiovascular disease, tumorigenesis, infection, wound repair, and fibrosis |CITS: [12213784]|. 
/
/ The most common disaccharide unit in dermatan sulfate is composed of |FRAME: CPD-12515| and |FRAME:CPD-12557|, which are often sulfated to |FRAME: CPD-12518|, |FRAME: CPD-12516|, |FRAME: CPD-12565| or |FRAME: CPD-12526|.
/
/Despite the fact that dermatan sulfate has been referred to as "chondroitin sulfate B", it differs from |FRAME: Chondroitin-sulfates| by the presence of |FRAME: CPD-12515| (although some of the disaccharide units may contain |FRAME: CPD-12521| as in chondroitin sulfate) and is not classified as such any more.

UNIQUE-ID - ILE2-tRNAs
TYPES - ILE-tRNAs
COMMON-NAME - tRNA<sup>Ile2</sup>
COMMENT - tRNA<sup>Ile2</sup> is an AUA codon-specific isoleucine tRNA. The unmodified tRNA<sup>Ile2</sup> bears the CAU anticodon, which is also found in tRNA<sup>Met</sup> responsible for AUG codon decoding.
/
/Archaeal tRNA<sup>Ile2</sup> with unmodified cytidine at position 34 is aminoacylated by methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) and deciphers the AUG codon, thus behaving like tRNA<sup>Met</sup>. Agmatinylation of that cytidine allows tRNA<sup>Ile2</sup> to read AUA instead of AUG |CITS: [ 20139989][22002222]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Cytochromes-C554
TYPES - Class-ID-Cytochromes-C
COMMON-NAME - a cytochrome <i>c554</i>
COMMENT - The tetraheme |FRAME: MONOMER-17537| from |FRAME: TAX-915| contains one high-spin and three low-spin c-type hemes. The main role of the protein is to accept pairs of electrons from |FRAME: CPLX-1321| (HAO) and transfer them to a cytochrome acceptor, the tetraheme |FRAME: MONOMER-17538| |CITS: [4372235]|.
/
/In addition, it has been shown that the protein also has significant nitric oxide (NO) reductase activity. Ferrous cytochrome <i>c</i>554 reduced NO at a rate greater than 16 s<sup>-1</sup>, which is comparable to rates of other known NO reductases |CITS: [16569009]|.
/
/The cycA gene that encodes the enzyme was identified by reverse translation of amino acid sequence obtained from peptides produced by proteolysis of the N-terminal region of the protein |CITS: [8195067]|. The sequencing of the complete genome revealed that three copies of the gene are present in the organism, named |FRAME: G-15261|, |FRAME: G-15266| and |FRAME: G-15267| |CITS: [12700255]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: 13-BETA-D-XYLANS "&beta;-1,3-D-xylan"| is a polysaccharide composed of &beta;-1,3-linked |FRAME: BETA-D-XYLOSE| residues. This polysaccharide was first found in the siphonous green seaweed |FRAME: TAX-148944| as a water-insoluble and alkaline-soluble component of cell walls |CITS: [Mackie59]|. It was subsequently found in cell walls of some red (|FRAME: TAX-2784| and |FRAME: TAX-31346|) and green (|FRAME: TAX-76312|, |FRAME: TAX-3128| and |FRAME: TAX-170436|) algae |CITS: [13852998][Fukushi86][Yamagaki96][12860427]|. It has not been detected in cell walls of land plants, which contain |FRAME: 1-4-beta-Xylan| instead.
/
/Analysis of |FRAME: 13-BETA-D-XYLANS "&beta;-1,3-D-xylan"| from the siphonous green alga |FRAME: TAX-177073| showed that it is a linear heteropolysaccharide also containing glucose residues linked by &beta;(1,3) linkages as well as some xylose residues linked by &beta;(1,4) linkages.

/
/AG type II, known as arabino-3,6-galactan, has a (1&rarr;3)-&beta;-D-Galp backbone heavily substituted at position 6 by mono- and oligosaccharide side chains composed of arabinosyl and galactosyl units. It is more widespread than the AG type I and occurs in cell walls of dicots and cereals often linked to proteins (known as arabinogalactan proteins). AG type II, along with galactomannans and cellulose, comprises the predominating polysaccharides of green arabica coffee beans|CITS: [11217967]|. In some case type II AGt contains a small amount of &beta;-glucuronate.
/
/AG type II occurs as minor, water-soluble components in softwoods. It is very abundant in the wood of larch trees (members of the genus |FRAME: TAX-3325|) - certain parts of the western larch (|FRAME: TAX-3327|) contain up to 35% AG |CITS: [Whistler93]|.

COMMENT - Chitosan is a linear polysaccharide composed of randomly distributed &beta;-(1-4)-linked D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units.
/Chitosan is found in the cell walls of some phytopathogenic fungi. The natural occuring chitosan has a degree of acetylation between 20-30%, with the acetyl residues grouped into clusters.

UNIQUE-ID - Porphyrans
TYPES - Red-Alage-Galactans
COMMON-NAME - a porphyran
COMMENT - Porphyran is a sulfated carbohydrate extracted from the cell wall of red seaweeds belonging to the genus |FRAME: TAX-2784| |CITS: [Anderson65]|. Unlike |FRAME: Agaroses agarose| and |FRAME: Carrageenans carrageenan|, porphyran is not utilized as ingredient for its gelling or texturizing properties. However, it is one of the most consumed algal polysaccharides because it is the main component of edible |FRAME: TAX-2788| and |FRAME: TAX-2785|, both of which are extensively used in the preparation of sushi |CITS: [Correc11]|.
/
/The backbone of porphyran is composed of about 30% of |FRAME: Agaroses agarose| repeating units (1,3-linked &beta;-D-galactopyranose followed by 1,4-linked 3,6-anhydro-&alpha;-L-galactopyranose), with the remaining residues being 3-linked &beta;-D-galactopyranose and 4-linked &alpha;-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate. The 4-linked &alpha;-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate residues can be converted to |FRAME: CPD-13430| by the enzyme |FRAME: 2.5.1.5-RXN "galactose-6-sulfurylase, EC 2.5.1.5"|.
/
/In addition, the galactan backboned is decorated by methyl-ether groups at the C6 position of the 3-linked &beta;-D-galactopyranose residues.
/
/As other sulfated galactans, porphyran may have some potential pharmacological applications |CITS: [18796647]|, based on, for example, its hypolipidemic |CITS: [19202270]| and anti-allergic properties |CITS: [16244430]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Arabinoxylan Arabinoxylan| molecules contain a chain of &beta;-1,4-linked xylose units, with many of the xylose units substituted with 2,2 or 2,3-linked arabinofuranose residues. The ratio of arabinose to xylose residues varies from 0.2 to 0.9 depending on the palnt and tissue.
/The arabinofuranose residues are often decorated further by acetyl, feruloyl and glucuronyl groups. The ferulate residues can form cross links between adjacent arabinoxylan molecules, forming |FRAME: Feraxan|.
/
/|FRAME: Arabinoxylan Arabinoxylans| are found in both the primary and secondary cell walls of plants, including woods and cereal grains, and are a component of |FRAME: Hemicelluloses|, the second most abundant renewable polysaccharide after cellulose. Arabinoxylan polymers are the major hemicellulose component of cell walls of the starchy endosperm (flour) and outer layers (bran) of the cereal grain, and have been identified in a variety of the main commercial cereals including wheat, rye, barley, oat, rice, corn and sorghum.

/Most of the glucuronoxylans have single 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-&alpha;-D-glucopyranosyl uronate residues (MeGlcA) attached at position 2. This structural type is usually named as 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-D-glucurono-D-xylan (MGX).
/
/Angiosperm (hardwood) glucuronoxylans also have a high rate of substitution (70-80%) by acetyl groups, at position 2 and/or 3 of the &beta;-D-xylopyranosyl, conferring on the xylan its partial solubility in water.
/
/The ratio of xylosyl residues to D-glucuronate/4-<i>O</i>-methylglucuronate residues in |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans glucuronoxylans| varies greatly among species.

/However, |FRAME: Glucuronoarabinoxylans Glucuronoarabinoxylans| consist of |FRAME: Arabinoxylan| backbone that contains about ten times more &alpha;-L-arabinofuranose side chains than glucuronate ones, while |FRAME: Arabinoglucuronoxylans arabinoglucuronoxylans| are |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans| with a small proportion of the xylopyranose residues of the backbone disubstituted by two &alpha;-L-arabinofuranose residues.
/
/Another difference is that |FRAME: Glucuronoarabinoxylans Glucuronoarabinoxylans| contain some xylopyranose units that are doubly substituted by both 4-<i>O</i>-methylglucuronate and &alpha;-L-arabinofuranose |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.
/
/Some of the arabinofuranose side chains in AGX are further substitued by either a &beta;-D-xylopyranose attached by a (1&rarr;2) linkage. This sugar moiety has been found usually esterified by ferulate at position 5 of the arabinofuranose unit and occur as a widespread component of grass cell walls |CITS: [Ishii97]|.
/
/The AGX type polymers occur in appreciable quantity in coniferous species, although it is usually not the dominant hemicellulosic component (an exception is the hemicellulose of the tropic conifer |FRAME: TAX-1030197| |CITS: [Bochicchio03]|).

UNIQUE-ID - CELLULOSE
TYPES - 1-4-beta-D-Glucan
COMMON-NAME - cellulose
COMMENT - Cellulose is the most common organic compound on Earth. It is a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to over ten thousand &beta;(1&rarr;4) linked D-glucose units, and is the structural component of the primary cell wall of green plants, many forms of algae and the oomycetes.
/
/Cellulose is a straight chain polymer. Unlike |FRAME: Starch starch| or |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen|, there is no coiling or branching, and the molecule adopts an extended and stiff rod-like conformation. The multiple hydroxyl groups on the glucose moieties from one chain form hydrogen bonds with oxygen atoms on neighbor chains, holding the chains firmly together side-by-side and forming microfibrils with high tensile strength. 
/
/Several different crystalline structures of cellulose are known, corresponding to the location of hydrogen bonds between and within strands. Known crystalline forms are named cellulose I, cellulose II, cellulose III and cellulose IV.  Cellulose I is further divided into I&alpha; and I&beta;, with the former formed by bacteria and algae and the latter by higher plants. 
/Crystalline cellulose is not soluble. It is converted to a soluble, amorphus structure only at a temperature of 320 &deg;C.
/
/Molecules with very small chain length, known as |FRAME: Cellodextrins cellodextrins|, are typically soluble in water and organic solvents.

/<b>About phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P):</b>
/
/Several studies found changes in intracellular PI5P levels during cell cycle progression, as well as upon thrombin treatment and osmotic stress |CITS: [10854858][11463365][11716778]|. The plant homeodomain-containing ING2 protein, a candidate tumor suppressor, was shown to act as a nuclear PI5P receptor, a function that regulates its ability to activate p53 |CITS: [12859901]|. PI5P has also been tied to tumor suppression via its potential regulation of Akt. It was demonstrated that the loss of PI5P, via a conversion to |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA|, resulted in a decrease in Akt activity |CITS: [12897244]|. In addition, PI5P was shown to enhance the activity of various myotubularin phosphatases (MTM1, MTMR3, and MTMR6) toward their preferred substrate |FRAME: 1-PHOSPHATIDYL-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-35-BISPH|, presumably through allosteric regulation |CITS: [12646134]|). Together these studies stress the importance of PI5P as a bona fide signaling molecule |CITS: [15247229]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans Glucuronoxylans| are a component of |FRAME: Hemicelluloses|. They are linear polymers of &beta;-D-xylopyranosyl units linked by (1&rarr;4) glycosidic bonds, with many of the xylose units substituted with 2,2 or 2,3-linked glucuronate residue, which are often methylated at position 4.
/Most of the glucuronoxylans have single 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-&alpha;-D-glucopyranosyl uronate residues (MeGlcA) attached at position 2. This structural type is usually named as 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-D-glucurono-D-xylan (MGX).
/
/An unusual heteroxylan in which some of the glucurunosyl residues are further substituted at position O-2 by |FRAME: ALPHA-D-GALACTOSE| has been reported from the wood of |FRAME: TAX-34317| |CITS: [10515063]|.
